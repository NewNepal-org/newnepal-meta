# **The Administrative Anatomy of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal: A Comprehensive Directory and Functional Analysis (2025 Edition)**

## **1\. Introduction: The Architecture of the Federal Republic**

The governance structure of Nepal, established under the Constitution of 2015, represents a fundamental restructuring of the state from a unitary monarchy to a Federal Democratic Republic. This transition was designed to decentralize power from Kathmandu to seven provinces and 753 local levels, creating a three-tier system of government based on the principles of coexistence, cooperation, and coordination.1 As of late 2025, the administrative landscape operates under a transitional interim administration led by Prime Minister Sushila Karki, following the dissolution of the previous government.2

This report provides an exhaustive directory and functional analysis of the Government of Nepal (GoN). It is designed as a definitive reference for the hierarchical and functional distribution of state power, mapping entities from the federal executive at Singha Durbar down to the ward committees in rural municipalities. The analysis synthesizes the legal mandates, organizational structures, and current leadership of these bodies, reflecting the political reality of the 2025 interim period.

The report is structured to guide the reader through the tiers of government: first, the Federal Executive and its ministries; second, the Constitutional Council and independent organs; third, the detailed administrative apparatus of the seven provinces; and finally, the granular directory of local governance, including District Coordination Committees and the municipal structure.

**2\. The Federal Executive: Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers**

The executive power of the Federation is vested in the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister.

**9\. Conclusion**

The "Comprehensive Directory of Nepal's Government Entities (2025 Edition)" serves as a testament to the extensive administrative reach of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. From the strategic corridors of the **Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers** in Singha Durbar to the grassroots governance of the **Phaktanglung Rural Municipality** in the Himalayas, this index captures the full spectrum of state power.

The transition to a federal structure has necessitated a massive expansion of government offices, particularly at the provincial and local levels. The directory highlights the establishment of full-fledged ministries in all seven provinces, mirroring the federal structure, and the operationalization of 753 local levels which now act as the primary interface between the citizen and the state. While the federal executive remains the core policy-making body, the functional weight of governance has increasingly shifted to the provincial ministries—such as the **Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development** in Madhesh or the **Ministry of Social Development** in Bagmati—and the local municipalities that manage daily service delivery.

As of late 2025, under the interim administration of Prime Minister Sushila Karki, these institutions continue to function, ensuring continuity in governance. This directory, with its detailed listings of ministries, departments, constitutional bodies, and local contacts, provides the essential data required to navigate this complex and evolving federal landscape.
