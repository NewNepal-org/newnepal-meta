### Judiciary (Federal Courts)

Nepal's judiciary is a separate branch of government, structured in
three
tiers[\[12\]](file://file_00000000473871fd8ea52469a9fbd8da#:~:text=Judicial%20Branch%20):

- **Supreme Court of Nepal (सर्वोच्च अदालत)** -- Located at Ram Shah Path,
  Kathmandu, it is the highest court in Nepal. The Supreme Court has
  nationwide jurisdiction and final judicial authority. It also
  supervises all lower courts. *(Contact: Supreme Court Registrar's
  Office, Kathmandu -- typically via the Supreme Court website or
  telephone exchange in Ram Shah
  Path.)*[\[12\]](file://file_00000000473871fd8ea52469a9fbd8da#:~:text=Judicial%20Branch%20)
- **High Courts (उच्च अदालत)** -- There are **7 High Courts**, one in
  each province (plus an additional bench in some cases). For example:
  **Biratnagar High Court** in Province 1 (Koshi), **Janakpur High
  Court** in Madhesh, **Patan High Court** in Bagmati (located in
  Lalitpur), **Pokhara High Court** in Gandaki, **Butwal High Court** in
  Lumbini (temporarily in Dipayal for Sudurpashchim until Godawari
  setup), **Surkhet High Court** in Karnali, and **Dipayal High Court**
  in Sudurpashchim. These High Courts hear appeals from District Courts
  and have benches in several locations.
- **District Courts (जिल्ला अदालत)** -- **77 District Courts**, one in
  each district headquarters, form the base of the judicial
  system[\[13\]](file://file_00000000473871fd8ea52469a9fbd8da#:~:text=).
  District Courts handle civil and criminal cases at the local level.
  They are usually located in the district's main town or city (often
  near the DAO or district police). Each District Court is headed by a
  Chief Judge (District Judge) and has several judges depending on case
  load.

Additionally, there are some **Specialized Courts and Tribunals** to
handle specific types of
cases[\[14\]](file://file_00000000473871fd8ea52469a9fbd8da#:~:text=).
Examples include: - **Special Court (विशेष अदालत)** in Kathmandu -- tries
high-profile corruption cases (often cases filed by CIAA). -
**Administrative Court (प्रशासनिक अदालत)** -- hears cases related to
civil service and administrative decisions. - **Revenue Tribunal (राजस्व
न्यायाधिकरण)** -- adjudicates tax and revenue disputes. - **Labor Court
(श्रम अदालत)** -- deals with labor and employment disputes. - **Debt
Recovery Tribunal/Banking Offense Tribunal (बैंकिङ कसुर सम्बन्धी
न्यायाधिकरण)** -- handles banking and financial fraud cases.

The **Office of the Attorney General** (महान्यायाधिवक्ताको कार्यालय),
though part of the executive branch, works closely with the judiciary.
The Attorney General is the chief legal advisor to the government and
has an office in Kathmandu (at Singh Durbar or nearby), with
**Government Attorney Offices** in each High Court and District Court to
represent the State in prosecutions.

### Security and Law Enforcement Agencies

- **Nepal Army (नेपाली सेना)** -- The national army, under the Ministry of
  Defense. **Headquarters:** Bhadrakali, Kathmandu (also known as Army
  HQ). The Nepal Army is deployed across the country in several
  divisions and brigades, with barracks and training centers in various
  regions. (E.g., the Mid-Western Division in Surkhet, Far-Western

  runs the National Defense University and military academies.
- **Nepal Police (नेपाल प्रहरी)** -- The primary law enforcement agency,
  under the Ministry of Home Affairs. **Headquarters:** Naxal,

  police circles, and over 2,000 police posts nationwide). Each
  **District Police Office (DPO)** (जिल्ला प्रहरी कार्यालय) is typically in
  the district headquarters town and oversees policing in all
  municipalities and rural areas of that district. For example, the
  Kathmandu District Police Office is at Ranipokhari, Kathmandu, while a
  remote district like Dolpa has its DPO in Dunai.
- **Armed Police Force (APF, सशस्त्र प्रहरी बल)** -- A paramilitary force
  also under the Home Ministry, focused on border security,
  counterinsurgency, and disaster response. **Headquarters:** Halchowk,

  and vital installations. (For instance, APF Battalions guard major
  border checkpoints and critical infrastructure).
- **National Investigation Department (NID, राष्ट्रिय अनुसन्धान विभाग)** --
  The intelligence agency of Nepal, under the Prime Minister's Office.
  **Head Office:** Kathmandu (reportedly at Singha Durbar). NID operates
  **branch offices in each province and major districts**, though its
  exact locations are classified. It handles national security
  intelligence and domestic surveillance.
- **Nepal Armed Forces** (collectively) also include specialized units
  like the **Nepalese peacekeeping force** (for UN missions) and the
  **President's Bodyguard Regiment** (ceremonial guards based at Shital
  Niwas). These are part of the Army's structure.
- **Note:** Law enforcement also includes specialized bodies like the
  **Department of Immigration** (which operates **Immigration Offices**

  **Nepalgunj (Banke)**, **Rasuwa (Rasuwagadhi)**, etc., each providing
  visa and immigration
  services[\[15\]](https://eyesonnepal.com/nepal-visa/#:~:text=Likewise%2C%20Land%20entry%2Fexit%20points%20offering,).
  Similarly, **Customs Offices** (under the Finance Ministry) operate at
  border points (e.g., Birgunj Customs, Biratnagar Customs, Kakadvitta,
  Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, etc., and the **Inland Clearance
  Depot** at Dry Ports). **Land Revenue Offices** exist in every

  located in the provincial capital and serves as the official
  residence/secretariat of the Governor. (E.g., *Office of the Province
  Chief, Koshi Province,
  Biratnagar*[\[27\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6,%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%2C%20%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0).)
  The Governor's Office often has a contact phone and website via the
  province portal.

- **Provincial Executive -- Chief Minister and Council of Ministers:**
  The **Chief Minister (मुख्यमन्त्री)** is the head of the provincial
  government, elected by the Provincial Assembly. The Chief Minister
  leads a cabinet of ministers. The **Office of the Chief Minister and
  Council of Ministers (OCMCM)** is effectively the provincial Prime
  Minister's office. It is located at the provincial capital (often in
  the main administrative complex of that province). For example,
  *Office of Chief Minister & Council of Ministers, Madhesh Province* is
  in Janakpur; *OCMCM, Bagmati Province* is in Hetauda; *OCMCM, Koshi
  Province* is in
  Biratnagar[\[28\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20%20,%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A3%20%20%2034).
  This office coordinates all provincial ministries and also links with
  the federal OPMCM.

- **Provincial Ministries (प्रदेश मन्त्रालयहरू):** Each province has a set of
  ministries that largely parallel the federal ministries, though fewer
  in number (usually around 7 to 10 ministries per province). These
  handle province-level responsibilities. Common **Provincial
  Ministries** (with names in Nepali) include:

- **Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law** (आन्तरिक मामिला तथा कानून
  मन्त्रालय) -- oversees provincial law & order (including oversight of
  police within the province in coordination with federal police), and
  legal affairs. *(Often also handles provincial home administration and
  governance.)*

- **Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning** (आर्थिक मामिला तथा योजना
  मन्त्रालय) -- handles provincial budget, economic policy, and
  development planning. (Each province prepares its own budget through
  this ministry.)

- **Ministry of Social Development** (सामाजिक विकास मन्त्रालय) -- looks
  after social sectors like health, education, and social welfare that
  are province matters. (In some provinces, Education and Health are
  separate, but many have a combined Social Development ministry.)

- **Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development** (भौतिक पूर्वाधार
  विकास मन्त्रालय) -- responsible for provincial roads, government
  buildings, irrigation at provincial level, and other infrastructure
  not managed federally.

- **Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment** (उद्योग,
  पर्यटन, वन तथा वातावरण मन्त्रालय) -- promotes local industries, tourism,
  and manages provincial forests and environmental conservation. *(The
  naming can vary: e.g., some provinces split these into two ministries
  or include Land management here.)*

- **Ministry of Agriculture and Land Management** (कृषि तथा भूमि व्यवस्था
  मन्त्रालय) -- manages agriculture, livestock services and land
  administration within the province. *(In some provinces, Agriculture
  is combined with Cooperatives or with Industry; e.g., Koshi Province
  has "Ministry of Industry, Agriculture and
  Cooperatives"[\[29\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=moial,%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97)
  instead of two separate ministries.)*

- **Ministry of Health** or **Ministry of Health and Population** --
  (स्वास्थ्य मन्त्रालय) manages healthcare services, provincial hospitals,
  and public health programs. *(If not separate, health comes under
  Social Development.)*

- **Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports** or **Education and
  Culture** -- some provinces have a dedicated Education ministry (शिक्षा
  मन्त्रालय) or combine it with culture or youth affairs. *(If not
  separate, education may be under Social Development.)*

- **Ministry of Water Supply, Irrigation and Energy** -- e.g., Koshi
  Province has a **Water, Irrigation and Energy Ministry (खानेपानी, सिंचाइ
  तथा उर्जा
  मन्त्रालय)**[\[30\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20%20moeap,%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97%2C%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%BF%20%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF),
  focusing on local water supply projects, small-scale energy and
  irrigation (areas not covered by federal large projects).

- **Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs** -- (if not combined with
  Industry/Forest, some provinces have standalone Tourism/Culture
  ministries).

Each provincial ministry has its **secretariat in the provincial
capital** (often within a provincial ministry complex). They may have
**Directorate Offices or divisional offices** for various sectors spread
across the province (for example, a Provincial Health Directorate,
Provincial Education Directorate in each province to supervise district
hospitals and schools). The official names and number of ministries can
differ slightly by province, but the above are generally
present[\[31\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81).
(For instance, **Bagmati Province** has ministries including Social
Development, Internal Affairs & Law, Physical Infrastructure,
Industry/Tourism/Forest, Agriculture/Cooperatives, etc., while **Madhesh
Province** as of recent years had ministries such as Industry, Forestry,
Tourism; Water Resources & Energy; Social Development (covering Health
and Education); Physical Infrastructure; etc.)

- **Provincial Assembly (प्रदेश सभा)** -- The unicameral legislature of
  the province. Each province has a Provincial Assembly located at the
  provincial capital (e.g., Province 1 Assembly in Biratnagar, Madhesh
  Assembly in Janakpur, etc.). The **Provincial Assembly Secretariat**
  (प्रदेश सभा सचिवariat) is the office that supports the Speaker and
  assembly members, and maintains legislative records. It is usually in
  the same city, sometimes the same complex, as the OCMCM. *(For
  example, Koshi Province Assembly Secretariat in
  Biratnagar[\[31\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81).)*
  The Provincial Assembly enacts laws on matters under provincial
  jurisdiction.

- **Provincial Public Service Commission (प्रदेश लोक सेवा आयोग)** --
  Provinces have the constitutional ability to form their own PSCs to
  recruit provincial civil servants. Some provinces have established
  these. For instance, **Koshi Province Public Service Commission** is
  active (with an office in
  Biratnagar)[\[32\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%87%20%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20,%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97),
  and Madhesh Province and Bagmati Province have also formed PSCs. These
  commissions announce vacancies for provincial and local level posts
  and conduct examinations, coordinating with the federal PSC. Their
  offices are typically in the provincial capital.

- **Provincial Attorney General's Office (मुख्य न्यायाधिवक्ता कार्यालय)** --
  The Chief Attorney (मुख्य न्यायाधिवक्ता) is the legal advisor to the
  provincial government, equivalent to a state Attorney General. This
  office represents the provincial government in legal matters and is
  located in the provincial capital (e.g., Office of Chief Attorney,
  Gandaki Province in
  Pokhara).[\[27\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6,%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%2C%20%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0)

- **Other Provincial Agencies:** Provinces have started to establish
  various agencies and boards, such as:

- **Provincial Planning Commission (प्रदेश योजना आयोग)** -- e.g., in some
  provinces to advise on development planning (Koshi Province has
  one[\[32\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%87%20%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20,%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97)).

- **Provincial Investment Board/Authority** -- e.g., Koshi Province has
  a Province Investment Authority (प्रदेश लगानी
  प्राधिकरण)[\[32\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%87%20%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%20,%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97)
  to promote investment in the province.

- **Directorates or Offices** for sectoral services: e.g., *Provincial
  Health Directorate*, *Provincial Education Directorate*, *Agriculture
  Development Directorate*, often headquartered in a central city (not
  always the capital if the ministry decides to base it elsewhere for
  convenience).

- **Provincial Police Unit** -- While police remain a federal entity,
  Nepal Police has Provincial Police Offices (headed by a Deputy
  Inspector General) in each province to coordinate policing with the
  Provincial Internal Affairs Ministry.

- **Provincial offices of Federal agencies** -- Many federal ministries
  maintain provincial-level offices of their departments. For example,
  the federal Department of Roads might have a *Provincial Road
  Directorate* in each province; Department of Small and Cottage
  Industry might have *Provincial Cottage Industry Offices*, etc. These
  are part of federal structure but work closely with provincial
  authorities.

*(Overall, each provincial government provides governance closer to the
people, handling local infrastructure, basic health and education, local
roads, agriculture extension, and law and order in coordination with
federal bodies. The provinces are still evolving entities, so their
offices and institutions are expanding. Official provincial portals
(e.g., koshi.gov.np, madhesh.gov.np) provide directories of all
provincial ministries and
agencies[\[31\]](https://koshi.gov.np/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81).)*

## District-Level Offices (जिल्ला तह)

There are **77 districts** in Nepal, which function as administrative
units bridging the provincial and local
levels[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=There%20are%2077%20districts%20with,gives%2022%20powers).
Under federalism, districts are not autonomous governments (local
governments are the 753 municipalities), but **district offices** of
both federal and provincial agencies remain crucial for coordination and
service delivery. Key district-level offices include:

- **District Administration Office (DAO, जिल्ला प्रशासन कार्यालय)** -- The
  DAO is the chief administrative extension of the **Ministry of Home
  Affairs** in each district. It is headed by a **Chief District Officer
  (CDO)**, who is a senior civil servant. The DAO's roles include
  maintaining law and order, disaster response coordination, citizenship
  certificate issuance, passport recommendations, and general
  coordination among all government offices in the district. Every
  district (77 total) has one DAO, usually located in the main town
  (district headquarters). For example, *Kathmandu District
  Administration Office* is in Babarmahal,
  Kathmandu[\[34\]](https://www.nepalyp.com/company/11275/District_Administration_Office#:~:text=Address);
  *Jhapa DAO* is in Chandragadhi; *Kaski DAO* in Pokhara; *Dolpa DAO* in
  Dunai, etc. **Contact:** DAOs have published phone numbers and emails;
  e.g., Kathmandu DAO's contact is Tel 01-4262448/4262478, Fax
  01-4267691[\[35\]](https://www.nepalyp.com/company/11275/District_Administration_Office#:~:text=Contact%20number),
  and general email format is daodistrict@moha.gov.np (e.g.,
  daoKathmandu@moha.gov.np for Kathmandu). The CDO is the key point of
  government authority in a district.

- **District Coordination Committee (DCC, जिल्ला समन्वय समिति)** -- The
  DCC (formerly known as District Development Committee in the old
  structure) is an elected committee in each district that coordinates
  among the municipalities and rural municipalities in that
  district[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=Further%20information%3A%20District%20administration%20in,Nepal).
  The DCC is formed by representatives (chiefs/deputies) of all local
  governments in the district. It has a small secretariat often called
  the District Coordination Office. The **DCC Office** is usually in the
  district headquarters, often in or near the old DDC building. The DCC
  does not have direct governing power over local units, but it
  facilitates inter-municipal coordination, infrastructure that spans
  multiple local units, and maintains some district-level statistics.
  For example, *Kathmandu District Coordination Committee* office is in
  Kathmandu city; *Sindhupalchowk DCC* is in Chautara, etc. Each DCC is
  chaired by an elected District Coordination Chairperson.

- **District Court (जिल्ला अदालत)** -- The main judicial authority at the
  district level, under the federal Judicial branch. Each of the 77
  districts has a District Court located typically at the district
  headquarters (often near administrative centers). The District Court
  hears local civil and criminal cases and also supervises adjudication
  by local Judicial Committees (municipal bodies) when needed. For
  instance, *Kathmandu District Court* sits at Babarmahal; *Jhapa
  District Court* is at Chandragadhi; *Accham District Court* at
  Mangalsen, etc. District Courts can be contacted via the judiciary's
  contact directories; they fall under the Supreme Court's
  administration[\[13\]](file://file_00000000473871fd8ea52469a9fbd8da#:~:text=).

- **District Police Office (जिल्ला प्रहरी कार्यालय)** -- This is the
  headquarters of the Nepal Police in each district, usually led by a
  Superintendent of Police (SP). The District Police Office (often
  abbreviated DPO) is typically located in the main town (e.g.,
  *District Police Office, Kaski* is in Pokhara; *DPO Dhanusha* in
  Janakpur; *DPO Sunsari* in Inaruwa). The DPO oversees all policing
  units in the district, including Urban Police Stations, Rural Police
  Posts, and Traffic Police offices. They handle crime investigation,
  law enforcement, and public safety at the district level. Contact
  info: Most DPOs have publicly listed phone numbers (often starting
  with 0XX- and some hotline 100 number) and are under the command of
  the provincial police office as well as Police HQ.

- **District Prison (कारागार)** -- Many districts have a district jail
  managed by the Department of Prisons (under Ministry of Home Affairs),
  usually located near the district police or administration office.
  These hold inmates serving short sentences or awaiting trial in
  District Court. (E.g., *Central Jail* in Kathmandu is the largest, but
  each district like Morang, Banke, etc., has a prison facility for
  local detainees.)

- **District Postal Service Office** -- Nepal Postal Services (under
  federal Ministry of Communication & IT) maintains a District Post
  Office in each district headquarters that oversees postal delivery in
  that district. For example, *District Post Office, Gorkha* in Gorkha
  Bazaar, etc. These offices manage mail, money orders, and now some
  government service payments.

- **Sectoral Offices at District Level:** Before federalism, there were
  many sectoral offices in each district under various ministries (often
  called **District Line Agencies**). With the restructuring, some have
  been moved under provincial government, some under federal, and some
  functions devolved to local governments. Key examples:

- **District Health Office (स्वास्थ्य कार्यालय)** -- In the past, every
  district had a District Public Health Office under the Health
  Ministry. Now, these have largely become **Health Offices** under
  provincial Social Development/Health Ministries. They supervise
  hospitals, health posts, and public health programs in the district.
  E.g., *District Health Office, Bajhang* is now under Sudurpashchim's
  Ministry of Social Development. They typically remain in the district
  hospital compound or a separate office in HQ.

- **District Education Office** -- Formerly under Ministry of Education
  to oversee schools, these have been transformed into **Education
  Development and Coordination Units** under the provincial education
  ministry. They coordinate with local governments (since schools are
  now managed by municipalities) and help with teacher postings, exams
  (like Grade 10 SEE exams), etc. The office is usually at the district
  HQ (e.g., *Education Development Coordination Unit, Ilam* at Ilam
  Bazaar).

- **District Agriculture Development Office** -- Previously under
  Ministry of Agriculture to provide agri extension services, now
  replaced by **Agriculture Knowledge Centers** or similar offices under
  provincial Ministry of Agriculture. For example, *Agriculture
  Knowledge Center, Chitwan* (in Bharatpur) handles agricultural
  programs in Chitwan.

- **District Forest Office** -- These are now **Division Forest
  Offices** under provincial Ministry of Forests. They manage forest
  resources, community forests, and wildlife at district level. E.g.,
  *Division Forest Office, Dang* in Ghorahi.

- **District Veterinary Office** -- Often merged with agriculture or
  under Livestock Service Offices in provinces.

- **District Irrigation Office**, **District Drinking Water Office**,
  **Survey Office**, **Land Revenue Office**, **Road Division Office**,
  **District Water and Sanitation** etc.: Many of these were under
  federal ministries; as of now, **Land Revenue Offices (Malpot)** and
  **Survey Offices** remain under the federal Ministry of Land
  Management, so each district still has a Land Revenue Office (for land
  registration, e.g., in district capital) and a Cadastral Survey
  Office[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=There%20are%2077%20districts%20with,gives%2022%20powers).
  **Road Division Offices** in each region/district (under Department of
  Roads, fed. Min. of Physical Infrastructure) handle highways and major
  road maintenance in their area. **Irrigation** and **Water Supply**
  offices have mostly moved under provinces or projects.

- **District Coordination Units of Federal Offices:** Some ministries
  maintain coordination units at district level even if primary
  responsibility shifted to local level. For example, **Women and
  Children Office** (for women development and children programs)
  existed in each district; some of their roles are now with local
  governments, but the offices might have been repurposed under
  provincial Social Development ministries or closed. **Small Cottage
  Industry Office** (for registering small industries) used to exist per
  district under Ministry of Industry; now local governments issue many
  licenses, but provinces might still have an industry office covering a
  few districts.

- **District-level Judiciary and Legal Services:** Aside from the
  District Court, districts also have **District Government Attorney
  Office** (Government Lawyer's Office under the Attorney General) which
  prosecutes cases on behalf of the state in the District Court. There
  may also be **District Bar Association** (not a gov office, but an
  important institution where lawyers in the district are organized,
  often with an office near the court).

In summary, at the district level, the **District Administration Office
(DAO)** and **District Coordination Committee (DCC)** are pivotal. The
DAO represents the central government's authority, and the DCC
represents collective local governments. Around them operate the
**District Court** (judicial arm) and **District Police** (law
enforcement), as well as various **sectoral offices** (health,
education, agriculture, etc., largely now under provincial control but
working locally). This ensures that even though elected local
governments (municipalities) handle local governance, there is
coordination and presence of higher-level government functions in each
district.

## Local Government Offices (स्थानीय तह)

Local governments are the lowest tier and the foundation of Nepal's
federal structure, providing direct governance and services to
communities. After the restructuring in 2017, Nepal has **753 local
government
units**[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=There%20are%2077%20districts%20with,gives%2022%20powers).
These are categorized as:

- **Metropolitan Cities (महानगरपालिका)** -- 6 large urban
  municipalities.
- **Sub-Metropolitan Cities (उपमहानगरपालिका)** -- 11 medium-sized urban
  centers.
- **Municipalities (नगरपालिका)** -- 276 smaller towns/urban
  municipalities.
- **Rural Municipalities (गाउँपालिका)** -- 460 village councils (rural
  local bodies).

Each local unit is a fully functional self-government with an elected
council. The council is headed by a **Mayor (नगर प्रमुख)** in
municipalities (or **Chairperson (अध्यक्ष)** in rural municipalities), and
a **Deputy Mayor/Deputy Chair**. The council consists of ward
representatives. Local governments have authority over local roads,
basic health, basic education, water supply, local markets, and more (22
exclusive powers in the Constitution's Schedule 8, and additional
concurrent
powers)[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=There%20are%2077%20districts%20with,5).

**Metropolitan Cities (6 in total):** These are the largest cities with
the highest population and revenue. They have extra administrative
sections due to their size. The metropolitan cities are:

1.  **Kathmandu Metropolitan City** (काठमाडौं महानगरपालिका) -- Province
    Bagmati, District Kathmandu. (Capital city of Nepal. Official city
    office at Baghdurbar, Kathmandu; Mayor's office at Kathmandu
    Metropolitan City Office. Website: kathmandu.gov.np).
2.  **Lalitpur Metropolitan City** (ललितपुर महानगरपालिका) -- Province
    Bagmati, District Lalitpur. (Part of Kathmandu Valley, office at
    Pulchowk, Lalitpur).
3.  **Biratnagar Metropolitan City** (विराटनगर महानगरपालिका) -- Province
    Koshi, District Morang. (Capital of Koshi Province; office at
    Biratnagar City).
4.  **Pokhara Metropolitan City** (पोखरा महानगरपालिका) -- Province
    Gandaki, District Kaski. (Provincial capital of Gandaki; office at
    New Road, Pokhara).
5.  **Bharatpur Metropolitan City** (भरतपुर महानगरपालिका) -- Province
    Bagmati, District Chitwan. (Central Nepal's major city; office in
    Bharatpur).
6.  **Birgunj Metropolitan City** (वीरगञ्ज महानगरपालिका) -- Province
    Madhesh, District Parsa. (Major border city adjoining India; office
    at Birgunj).

Each metropolitan city has multiple departments (education, urban
planning, environment, etc.) and manages services for a large
population. For example, Kathmandu Metropolitan has 32 wards and a
population over a million.

**Sub-Metropolitan Cities (11 in total):** These are the next tier of
urban centers. They include:

- **Janakpur Sub-Metropolitan City** (जनकपुर उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Madhesh
  Province, Dhanusha District (also the capital of Madhesh Province).
- **Hetauda Sub-Metropolitan City** (हेटौडा उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Bagmati
  Province, Makwanpur District (capital of Bagmati Province).
- **Itahari Sub-Metropolitan City** (इटहरी उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Koshi
  Province, Sunsari District.
- **Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City** (धरान उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Koshi
  Province, Sunsari District.
- **Kalaiya Sub-Metropolitan City** (कलैया उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Madhesh
  Province, Bara District.
- **Jitpur Simara Sub-Metropolitan City** (जीतपुरसिमरा उपमहानगरपालिका) --
  Madhesh Province, Bara District. (Also known as Gadhimai in some
  sources)
- **Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City** (बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Lumbini
  Province, Rupandehi District.
- **Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolitan City** (नेपालगंज उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Lumbini
  Province, Banke District.
- **Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City** (घोराही उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Lumbini
  Province, Dang District.
- **Dhangadhi Sub-Metropolitan City** (धनगढी उपमहानगरपालिका) --
  Sudurpashchim Province, Kailali District.
- **Bhimdatta (Mahendranagar) Sub-Metropolitan City** (भीमदत्त
  उपमहानगरपालिका) -- Sudurpashchim Province, Kanchanpur District.

*(These are 11 in total; the list covers all.)* Each sub-metropolitan
city has an municipal office (नगरपालिका कार्यालय) headed by the Mayor.
They perform similar functions as metros, just at a slightly smaller
scale (populations typically a few hundred thousand).

**Municipalities (276):** These are smaller towns. Every district has at
least one (often several) municipalities except a few mountainous ones.
Notable examples: **Tansen Municipality** (Palpa), **Damak
Municipality** (Jhapa), **Putalibazar Municipality** (Syangja), **Jumla
(Chandannath) Municipality** (Jumla), etc. Due to their large number, we
list them by province in summary:

- **Koshi Province** -- 1 Metropolitan (Biratnagar), 2 Sub-Metros
  (Itahari, Dharan), and **46 Municipalities** (e.g., Inaruwa,
  Mechinagar, Ilam, Damak, Dhankuta,
  etc.)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=Wards%20%20%201%2C157%20,85%20109%2079%2088%20753).
- **Madhesh Province** -- 1 Metro (Birgunj), 3 Sub-Metros (Janakpur,
  Kalaiya, Jitpur Simara), and **73 Municipalities** (e.g., Malangawa,
  Lahan, Birendrabazar, Rajbiraj, etc.).
- **Bagmati Province** -- 3 Metros (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bharatpur), 1
  Sub-Metro (Hetauda), and **41 Municipalities** (e.g., Banepa,
  Bhaktapur, Dolakha's Charikot, Sindhulimadi, etc.).
- **Gandaki Province** -- 1 Metro (Pokhara), 0 Sub-Metro, and **26
  Municipalities** (e.g., Gorkha, Baglung, Besisahar, Tansen
  *\[Correction: Tansen is actually in Lumbini\]*, etc.).
- **Lumbini Province** -- 0 Metro, 4 Sub-Metros (Butwal, Nepalgunj,
  Ghorahi, Kapilvastu's *Kapilvastu or Tilottama?*, actually Tilottama
  is municipality; the 4th sub-metro is *Tulsipur?* Correction: Tulsipur
  is sub-metro in Dang), and **32 Municipalities** (e.g.,
  Siddharthanagar, Tansen, Bharatpur was Bagmati, sorry *Bharatpur is
  Bagmati*, in Lumbini we have Gulariya, Bhairahawa (Siddharthanagar),
  etc.).
- **Karnali Province** -- 0 Metro, 0 Sub-Metro, and **25
  Municipalities** (e.g., Birendranagar is the only big town but it's a
  municipality capital, others include Musikot, Chaurjahari, Jumla
  (Chandannath), etc.).
- **Sudurpashchim Province** -- 0 Metro, 1 Sub-Metro (Dhangadhi), and
  **33 Municipalities** (e.g., Mahendranagar is sub-metro Bhimdatta,
  plus Dipayal Silgadhi, Tikapur, Dadeldhura, etc.).

*(The above breakdown shows how municipalities are spread; the total
number of urban municipalities is 293 if counting metros, sub-metros,
and municipalities
combined[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=Wards%20%20%201%2C157%20,85%20109%2079%2088%20753).)*

**Rural Municipalities (460):** These are local governments in rural
areas, often covering multiple villages. Rural municipalities
(gaunpalikas) have a Chairperson instead of Mayor, but otherwise
function similarly with an executive council and wards. Every district
that is not fully urban has several gaunpalikas. For example: **Khumbu
Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality** in Solukhumbu, **Namkha Rural
Municipality** in Humla, **Jugal Rural Municipality** in Sindhupalchowk,
**Narainapur Rural Municipality** in Banke, etc. The number of rural
municipalities by province: Koshi 88, Madhesh 59, Bagmati 74, Gandaki
58, Lumbini 73, Karnali 54, Sudurpashchim
54[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=Wards%20%20%201%2C157%20,85%20109%2079%2088%20753).

**Local Government Offices:** Each of the 753 local units has its own
**municipal office building** (sometimes called *"नगरपालिका कार्यालय"*
for municipalities or *"गाउँपालिका कार्यालय"* for rural municipalities).
This is the administrative center of the local government, where the
Mayor/Chairperson, executive officer, and staff work. It is typically
located within the municipality (often in a central town or market
area). The office handles services like: registration of births, deaths,
marriages; local tax collection; issuance of recommendations and local
permits; maintenance of local roads, schools, and clinics; and meetings
of the local council. Many municipalities have official websites and
published contact info. For example, **Kathmandu Metropolitan City
Office** (City Hall) can be contacted at 01-4254310, and **Siddhicharan
Municipality Office** (Okhaldhunga) has contact info on its site, etc.

Local governments also often maintain service centers or ward offices
within their territory for easier public access. For instance,
metropolitan and sub-metropolitan cities have **Urban Ward Offices** in
each ward; rural municipalities might have small ward office buildings
in each ward village.

To illustrate how local offices are organized, consider a district
example: **Kaski District (Gandaki Province)** -- contains 1
Metropolitan City (Pokhara) and 4 rural municipalities (Annapurna, Madi,
Machhapuchchhre, Rupa). Pokhara Metropolitan's main office is in Pokhara
city, and it has 33 ward offices across the city. Each rural
municipality like Annapurna has its office (in an accessible village
like Sikles or Lumle) and wards (generally 5--10 wards) each with a ward
chair and ward office. Similar patterns follow in other districts.

A **comprehensive list of all local governments** by district is
available via official publications (for example, the Ministry of
Federal Affairs (MoFAGA) published the list of 753 local units in the
Nepal Gazette). One such compiled list enumerates every local unit under
each province and
district[\[39\]](https://chinarinepal.com/5737-2/#:~:text=Nepal%20has%20753%20local%20levels%2C,divided%20into%20the%20following%20categories).
Due to the extensive number, we won't list all names here, but it is
understood that **every one of the 77 districts** has a set of
municipalities/rural municipalities that cover its entire area.

**Local Government Associations:** There are also bodies like the
**Municipal Association of Nepal (MuAN)** and **National Association of
Rural Municipalities** that have offices in Kathmandu and work as
umbrella organizations for these local governments, but these are not
government offices per se, rather networks.

## Ward Offices (वडा कार्यालय)

**Wards** are the smallest administrative units of local government.
Each municipality or rural municipality is subdivided into wards
(constitutionally, a ward is called "Ward Committee"). There are **6,743
wards in Nepal** in
total[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Nepal#:~:text=Area%20type%20%20Koshi%20,85%20109%2079%2088%20753).
Each ward has an elected **Ward Chairperson (वडा अध्यक्ष)** and 4 Ward
Members, forming the Ward Committee. The ward is not a fully autonomous
level of government (it's a unit of the municipality), but it has a
significant role in local service delivery and community development.

Every ward typically has a **Ward Office (वडा कार्यालय)**, often a small
office located within that ward's area (for rural wards, it could be a
room in a village school or a purpose-built ward office; in urban wards,
there may be designated ward office buildings). The Ward Office is
staffed by ward secretary and support staff (appointed bureaucrats) and
is the first point of contact for citizens for many services, such as:
registering births, deaths, marriages; recommending documents for
citizenship or passports; local dispute mediation (small disputes can be
mediated by Ward Chair or forwarded to the municipality's Judicial
Committee); and implementing neighborhood-level projects.

For example, **Kathmandu Metropolitan City Ward No. 5 Office** is in
Kamaladi, Kathmandu, and **Ward No. 5 Office of Khumulung Rural
Municipality** might be in a village within that ward. The Ward Chair
leads local initiatives and coordinates with the municipal office.

The **number of wards per local unit** varies by population and area (a
metropolitan city can have 32 wards -- e.g., Kathmandu has 32, Pokhara
33; a sub-metro might have around 19--21 wards; municipalities typically
have 9 to 15 wards; rural municipalities usually have 5 to 11 wards as
set by law). The Constitution ensured at least 5 wards per rural
municipality. For instance, each rural municipality in mountainous areas
often has 5 or 6 wards (due to low population but large area), while an
urban municipality might have 10 or more wards if population is higher.

Ward Offices generally don't have separate phone lines listed
nationally, but are reachable via the municipal office or local notice
boards. They often display a signboard with the ward number and
municipality name. Local residents interact with Ward Offices frequently
for recommendations (प्रमाणित पत्र), local taxes (some minor taxes/fees
are collected at ward level), and community meetings.

**Local Service Centers:** In some municipalities, especially larger
ones, there are also **Area Administration Offices or Service Centers**
to decentralize services. For example, Kathmandu has an ward cluster
office concept for services like issuing marriage certificates.
Additionally, the federal government's **Nagarik Facilitation Centers
(Citizen Service Centers)** are often established at municipalities to
provide integrated services.

In summary, **Ward Offices** represent the government at the
neighborhood/village level -- they are the grassroots administrative
units ensuring that the approximately **30 million citizens** of Nepal
have a local access point to their government.
