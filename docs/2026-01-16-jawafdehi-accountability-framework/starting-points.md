# Notes

## The Accountability Infrastructure

1. Nepali people believe that there is rampant corruption at all levels of governance (i.e. The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) is high).
2. Politicization of the accountability organs (CIAA, CIB, and others) has systematically weakened the National Accountability Infrastructure.
3. The primary GenZ mandate was to end this culture of unaccountability:
4. Nepal is weak in accountability fundamentals (citizen literacy, digitization, transparency, etc.).
5. Due to this, we cannot expect that even if new forces win in the election, Nepal's effective accountability will improve.

There is a need to discuss about a national accountability framework, soemthing like a 10 year roadmap for all affiliated stakeholders to coordinate.

Accountability Infrastructure.
Consists of:
- Government Organs
- Civic Society Groups
- Media
- Nepali Citizens
- External Organizations (UN, Donor Nations, etc.)

We have focused enormously on the government side [^1], but civic aspect remains weak, and fragmented.

Jawafdehi is posited in this bridge: connecting civic society groups, media, and citizens.

< More on jawafdehi here, on its evidence backing, and such; see docs/jawafdehi-overview/overview.md>

What we want to preserve is the long term memory against acts of corruption.
