# **Forensic Audit and Governance Review: The Nepal Airlines Wide-Body Aircraft Procurement Scandal**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

The procurement of two Airbus A330-200 wide-body aircraft by the Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) represents a seminal case study in the pathology of public sector corruption within the Himalayan republic. Initiated in 2015 with the ostensibly noble strategic objective of revitalizing the national flag carrier’s long-haul capabilities, the procurement process devolved into a sophisticated financial crime involving bid-rigging, the unlawful utilization of shell companies, and the deliberate manipulation of technical specifications. The resulting scandal, widely referred to as the "Wide-Body Scam," has implicated the highest echelons of Nepal's political and bureaucratic leadership, exposed critical fissures in the nation’s anti-corruption framework, and saddled the state-owned airline with debilitating debt.

This comprehensive report reconstructs the entire lifecycle of the procurement—from the initial board decisions in 2016 to the landmark Supreme Court appeal filed in December 2025\. It provides a granular analysis of the forensic evidence, reconciling the divergent financial loss estimates provided by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). Furthermore, it fills the Jawafdehi Case Entry Template to provide a structured accountability log for this complex case.

The investigation reveals that the corruption was not incidental but architectural. The decision to bypass the Public Procurement Act (PPA) by utilizing NAC’s internal financial bylaws to purchase "old" aircraft—despite the intention to acquire new ones—created the legal grey zone necessary for intermediaries to infiltrate the deal. The subsequent selection of a consortium led by AAR Corp, the unauthorized transfer of the contract to a virtually capitalized Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in Ireland (Hi Fly X Ireland Limited), and the acceptance of aircraft with a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 230 tonnes instead of the contracted 242 tonnes, collectively resulted in a confirmed financial loss to the state of NPR 1.47 billion. Broader economic analyses by parliamentary bodies suggest the total irregularity, including opportunity costs and irrational price escalations, exceeds NPR 4.35 billion.

The judicial resolution of this case remains in flux. While the Special Court’s verdict on December 5, 2024, resulted in the conviction of key bureaucratic figures—including former Managing Director Sugat Ratna Kansakar and former Tourism Secretary Shankar Prasad Adhikari—it simultaneously acquitted the political leadership, specifically former Tourism Minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi. This dichotomy has sparked intense public and judicial scrutiny, culminating in the CIAA’s appeal to the Supreme Court on December 2, 2025\. Moreover, the Special Court’s explicit censure of the CIAA for failing to investigate its own current Chief Commissioner, Prem Kumar Rai, who chaired the initial procurement decisions, highlights a profound conflict of interest that threatens the integrity of Nepal’s governance institutions.

This report serves as a definitive historical and forensic record of the case, synthesizing thousands of pages of parliamentary findings, court verdicts, and international investigative disclosures into a unified narrative of systemic failure and partial accountability.

**3\. Introduction: The Strategic Imperative and the Seeds of Malfeasance**

The genesis of the Wide-Body scandal lies in the genuine operational crisis faced by Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) in the mid-2010s. Once a robust carrier connecting Kathmandu to London, Osaka, and Frankfurt, NAC had withered into a regional airline with an aging fleet of Boeing 757s and two narrow-body Airbus A320s. The lack of long-haul capacity meant that the lucrative market of Nepali diaspora travel—particularly from Australia, Europe, and Japan—was entirely ceded to foreign carriers like Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and Etihad.

### **3.1 The Strategic Business Plan**

In 2015, under the leadership of Managing Director Sugat Ratna Kansakar, NAC formulated a bold 10-year business plan. The cornerstone of this plan was the acquisition of two wide-body aircraft capable of non-stop operations to Sydney and direct flights to European capitals. The technical requirement was specific: the aircraft needed a **Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 242 tonnes**. This specification was critical because Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) is located at an altitude of 1,338 meters (4,390 feet) and has a challenging runway configuration. A higher MTOW allows an aircraft to carry more fuel and payload, enabling it to overcome the performance penalties of a "hot and high" airport and still reach distant destinations.14

### **3.2 The Financing Structure**

The procurement was the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, valued at nearly USD 210 million. To finance this, the government directed state-owned financial institutions—the **Employees Provident Fund (EPF)** and the **Citizen Investment Trust (CIT)**—to extend loans to NAC. This decision itself was controversial, as it exposed the retirement savings of Nepali citizens to the high-risk aviation sector. The loans were secured against the aircraft themselves and a government guarantee, creating a sovereign liability.16

However, parallel to these legitimate strategic moves, a conspiracy was being hatched to manipulate the procurement process for personal gain. The intent to defraud was not an afterthought; the forensic evidence suggests it was embedded in the very design of the tender.

## ---

**4\. The Procurement Architecture: Engineering the Loophole (2015–2016)**

The fundamental challenge for the conspirators was the **Public Procurement Act, 2063 (2007)**. This legislation mandates strictly competitive bidding for large-scale government purchases and generally favors direct procurement from manufacturers to ensure warranty, quality, and the elimination of middleman markups. To circumvent these protections, the NAC management and board devised a legal workaround that would define the entire trajectory of the scandal.

### **4.1 The "Old Aircraft" Bypass (Clause 236\)**

On **April 14, 2016**, the NAC Board of Directors met under the chairmanship of **Prem Kumar Rai**, who was then the Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA). At this meeting, the board made a pivotal decision to proceed with the procurement not under the standard provisions for new equipment, but under **Clause 236(1)** of the **NAC Financial Bylaws, 2065**.7

This clause was designed for the purchase of *second-hand* or *used* aircraft, allowing for a more flexible negotiation process suitable for the used market where fixed prices do not exist. However, the board simultaneously set a condition that the aircraft must have flown **no more than 1,000 hours**.

**Forensic Insight:** This condition contains an inherent contradiction that signals malfeasance. An Airbus A330 with 1,000 flight hours is, for all practical purposes, a brand-new aircraft (a typical commercial jet flies 3,000–4,000 hours a year). By classifying a essentially new asset as "old," NAC achieved two objectives:

1. **Exclusion of Airbus:** They could not buy directly from Airbus under the "old" aircraft clause, as the manufacturer sells new planes. This provided a legal pretext to reject any direct engagement with the manufacturer.  
2. **Introduction of Middlemen:** It forced the procurement into the domain of leasing companies and asset traders, creating layers of opacity where commissions could be concealed.14

This decision by the Prem Kumar Rai-led board is what the Special Court later identified as the "origin" of the corruption, questioning why the CIAA investigation shielded Rai while prosecuting those who implemented this very decision.12

## ---

**5\. The Bidding Charade: Rigging the Request for Proposal (2016)**

With the legal loophole established, the execution phase began with the issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP). The investigation by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) into **AAR Corp** has provided a smoking gun regarding the integrity of this process.

### **5.1 The Insider Information**

According to US court documents and admissions by AAR Corp, the RFP process was a sham. **Deepak Sharma**, a British national and President of AAR International, was in direct contact with Nepali officials long before the tender was public.

* **Draft Circulation:** Sharma received confidential drafts of the RFP months in advance.  
* **The "Designed for Us" Email:** On **September 26, 2016**, the day the RFP was officially issued, Sharma emailed his colleagues at AAR stating that the RFP was "designed for us".8  
* **Tailored Specs:** The requirement for aircraft manufactured after January 2014 with fewer than 1,000 hours was tailored to match inventory that AAR Corp believed it could secure or "flip" from other airlines (specifically Tibet Airlines or Iberia, though the final MSNs were different).14

### **5.2 The Selection of the Consortium**

In **November 2016**, NAC selected a consortium comprising three entities:

1. **AAR Corp (USA)**  
2. **German Aviation Capital (Germany)**  
3. **Hi Fly (Portugal)**

The consortium proposed to supply two A330-200 aircraft at a price of **USD 104.8 million** each. While this appeared to be a valid international bid, the subsequent structural changes to the contracting parties would strip NAC of its financial security.1

## ---

**6\. The Financial Labyrinth: Shell Companies and Escrow Fraud (2017)**

Following the selection of the AAR-led consortium, the transaction entered a phase of complex financial engineering designed to obscure the money trail.

### **6.1 The "Bait and Switch" to Hi Fly X Ireland**

The Public Procurement Act generally prohibits the transfer of contractual obligations to a third party not evaluated during the bidding process. However, immediately after the MoU was signed in **January 2017**, the consortium informed NAC that the actual seller would not be the consortium members but a "Special Purpose Company" (SPC).1

On **February 21, 2017**, a company named **Hi Fly X Ireland Limited** was incorporated in Dublin. This entity was a classic "shell company" with a paid-up capital of only USD 1 (or 1 Euro in some records).16

* **The Risk:** NAC was asked to sign the final Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with this shell company. This meant that if the aircraft were defective or never delivered, NAC’s legal recourse would be limited to an entity with no assets.  
* **The Facilitation:** Despite this glaring risk, NAC management, led by MD **Sugat Ratna Kansakar** and endorsed by the board, proceeded to transfer the purchase contract to Hi Fly X Ireland. The CIAA and the Special Court later identified this substitution of the contracting party as a primary mechanism of the corruption.14

### **6.2 The Escrow Account Deception**

Payment for the aircraft was structured through an escrow agent—**Norton Rose Fulbright**, a reputable international law firm. However, the flow of funds revealed irregularities.

* **Dollar Exchange Facility:** The investigation found that payments were made to the escrow agent without the requisite bank guarantees that usually accompany such massive public fund transfers.  
* **The Disappearing Money:** NAC transferred a total of USD 209.6 million. The funds flowed from the escrow account to Hi Fly X Ireland. From there, the money trail becomes opaque, but the US DOJ investigation confirmed that AAR Corp used "intermediaries" to pay bribes to Nepali officials to secure the deal. Specifically, AAR admitted to paying **USD 2.5 million** in bribes.5

## ---

**7\. Technical Fraud: The Case of the Missing Tonnage**

While the financial structuring was illicit, the operational fraud committed against NAC was even more damaging. The core value of the wide-body aircraft lay in its performance capabilities, which were surreptitiously downgraded.

### **7.1 The MTOW Discrepancy**

The RFP and the business plan were explicitly based on the **242-tonne MTOW** variant of the A330-200. This variant is the "high-gross-weight" version, designed for long-range missions.

* **The Delivery:** When the aircraft (registrations **9N-ALY** and **9N-ALZ**) arrived in June and July 2018, technical inspections revealed they were certified for only **230 tonnes MTOW**.15  
* **The Impact:** A 12-tonne reduction in takeoff weight directly translates to a 12-tonne reduction in fuel or payload capacity. For a flight from Kathmandu to London or Sydney, this reduction makes the route commercially unviable because the plane cannot carry enough passengers and cargo to be profitable while carrying the necessary fuel reserves.

### **7.2 The Financial Implication of the Downgrade**

The **242-tonne** variant commands a significantly higher market price than the **230-tonne** variant.

* **Overpayment:** NAC paid the price negotiated for the superior 242T aircraft but accepted the inferior 230T aircraft.  
* **Loss Calculation:** The CIAA estimated that this specific discrepancy resulted in a direct loss of **USD 13.38 million** (approx. NPR 1.47 billion). This figure forms the basis of the primary corruption charge.19 The officials involved did not merely make a mistake; they accepted a non-compliant product that permanently handicapped the airline's strategic potential.

## ---

**8\. The Investigation Phase: Uncovering the Rot (2018–2023)**

The arrival of the aircraft in 2018 triggered immediate skepticism. The Auditor General's 55th Annual Report was the first to flag the procedural violations. This led to a high-profile parliamentary inquiry.

### **8.1 The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Inquiry (2018-2019)**

The PAC formed a sub-committee led by MP **Rajan KC** to investigate the procurement. Their report, submitted in **January 2019**, was explosive.

* **Findings:** The report concluded that the procurement involved "unprecedented corruption." It highlighted the MTOW fraud, the illegal use of the "old aircraft" clause, and the suspicious price escalation formula.  
* **Estimated Loss:** The PAC calculated the total irregularity at **NPR 4.35 billion**. This figure included the direct loss from the MTOW downgrade, the artificial price escalation (approx. USD 6.8 million), and the loss of potential discounts (USD 23.6 million) that should have been available for aircraft of that vintage.6  
* **Recommendations:** The PAC recommended legal action against the incumbent Minister **Rabindra Adhikari** (who tragically died shortly after in a helicopter crash), former ministers **Jeevan Bahadur Shahi** and **Jitendra Narayan Dev**, and secretaries including **Prem Kumar Rai** and **Shankar Prasad Adhikari**.6

### **8.2 The "Deep Freeze" and CIAA Inaction**

Despite the PAC's scathing report, the investigation by the CIAA stalled for nearly five years. This period of inaction raised serious questions about political interference. The "Deep Freeze" coincided with the appointment of **Prem Kumar Rai**—one of the key individuals named in the PAC report—as the Chief Commissioner of the CIAA. This created an institutional paradox: the head of the anti-corruption body was a primary suspect in the very case his agency was supposed to investigate.

## ---

**9\. The Judicial Phase I: The Charge Sheet (April 2024\)**

On **April 4, 2024**, breaking years of silence, the CIAA finally filed a charge sheet at the Special Court. However, the scope of the charges immediately drew criticism for being carefully curated.

### **9.1 The Accused**

The CIAA charged **32 individuals**, seeking a recovery of **NPR 1.47 billion**. The defendants included:

1. **Jeevan Bahadur Shahi:** Former Tourism Minister (accused of authorizing the price escalation and technical deviations).  
2. **Sugat Ratna Kansakar:** NAC Managing Director (accused of being the architect of the deal).  
3. **Shankar Prasad Adhikari:** Former Tourism Secretary and NAC Chair.  
4. **Shishir Kumar Dhungana:** Former Finance Secretary and NAC Board Member.  
5. **Foreign Nationals:** Representatives from AAR Corp (Deepak Sharma), German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly.9

### **9.2 The Notable Exclusion**

Conspicuously absent from the charge sheet was **Prem Kumar Rai**. The CIAA’s rationale appeared to be that the corruption occurred during the *execution* of the procurement (2017), not during the *initiation* (2016) when Rai was in charge. This distinction would later be fiercely attacked by the Special Court.21

## ---

**10\. The Judicial Phase II: The Special Court Verdict (December 2024\)**

On **December 5, 2024**, a bench of the Special Court comprising Chairman Tek Narayan Kunwar and Members Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Ritendra Thapa delivered its verdict. The judgment was a mix of severe punishment for bureaucrats and controversial leniency for politicians.

### **10.1 Convictions and Sentences**

The court convicted **10 individuals** and upheld the CIAA’s claim of **NPR 1.47 billion** in losses.

* **Sugat Ratna Kansakar:** Convicted of corruption. Sentenced to **2 years and 9 months** imprisonment. Due to his age (over 74), his sentence was reduced by 50% under the Senior Citizens Act.4  
* **Shankar Prasad Adhikari:** Convicted. Sentenced to **1 year and 9 months** imprisonment plus a fine of NPR 122.59 million.11  
* **Shishir Kumar Dhungana & Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane:** Convicted. Sentenced to **1 year and 6 months** imprisonment plus fines.4  
* **Foreign Nationals:** Deepak Sharma (AAR), Christian Nuehlen (Hi Fly X), and others were convicted in absentia. The court ordered the recovery of fines from their assets, though enforcement remains a challenge.11

### **10.2 Acquittals**

The court acquitted **22 individuals**, most notably former Minister **Jeevan Bahadur Shahi**.

* **Reasoning:** The court ruled that while Shahi was the Minister, the prosecution failed to provide direct evidence that he personally benefited from the funds or that he directly ordered the technical deviation (MTOW reduction). The court viewed the corruption as a "technical and administrative" crime orchestrated by the board and management, isolating the political leadership from criminal liability.4

### **10.3 Judicial Censure of "Selective Prosecution"**

In a move that reverberated through Nepal’s legal community, the full text of the verdict (released in July 2025\) contained a stinging rebuke of the CIAA. The court questioned why **Prem Kumar Rai** was not charged.

* **The Court's Logic:** The verdict stated, *"The procurement process began on April 14, 2016... chaired by then Tourism Secretary Prem Kumar Rai. The CIAA did not challenge the legality of that board decision... Adopting a selective approach—prosecuting some while excluding others involved in the same act—demonstrates a biased and discriminatory attitude"*.7  
* **Implication:** The court essentially accused the CIAA of protecting its own Chief Commissioner, undermining the credibility of the entire prosecution.

## ---

**11\. The Judicial Phase III: The Supreme Court Appeal (December 2025\)**

The verdict satisfied no one. The CIAA, stung by the acquittals of the politicians and arguably needing to demonstrate independence following the court's criticism, filed an appeal at the Supreme Court on **December 2, 2025**.

### **11.1 Grounds for Appeal**

The CIAA’s appeal challenges the Special Court's decision on two primary grounds:

1. **Vicarious Liability of the Minister:** The CIAA argues that a Minister cannot be absolved of responsibility for a multi-billion rupee procurement under his ministry. They contend that the approval of the price escalation and the acceptance of the flawed aircraft required ministerial consent, making Shahi complicit.10  
2. **Inadequacy of Punishment:** The CIAA argues that the acquittals of the 14 NAC employees and board members were erroneous, as their silence and participation in the sub-committees facilitated the crime.22

As of late December 2025, the case is pending at the Supreme Court. The outcome will likely define the standards of "Ministerial Responsibility" in Nepal for decades to come.

## ---

**12\. Forensic Accounting: Reconciling the Loss Figures**

A persistent source of confusion in the public discourse has been the variance between the loss figures cited by the PAC (NPR 4.35 Billion) and the CIAA/Special Court (NPR 1.47 Billion). A forensic reconciliation clears this ambiguity.

| Category of Loss | PAC Estimate (NPR) | CIAA/Court Finding (NPR) | Forensic Explanation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **MTOW Capacity Loss** | \~920 Million | \~1.47 Billion | PAC estimated the loss of *revenue potential*. CIAA calculated the *overpayment* for the asset (paying for 242T, getting 230T). The CIAA's figure is legally tighter for criminal prosecution. |
| **Price Escalation** | \~700 Million | Included in above | The illicit price escalation (inflation adjustment) was folded into the total claim by CIAA. |
| **Lost Discounts** | \~2.6 Billion | 0 | PAC argued NAC *could* have gotten discounts for buying "old" planes. CIAA excluded this because "lost opportunity" is hard to prove as criminal theft in court. |
| **Operational Waste** | \~10 Million | 0 | The "junket" expenses (trips to France) were deemed administrative waste, not criminal embezzlement, by the CIAA. |
| **Total** | **4.35 Billion** | **1.47 Billion** | **The CIAA focused on the "recoverable" criminal amount, while PAC focused on the "total economic damage" to the nation.** |

## ---

**13\. Systemic Governance Failures and Conclusion**

The Nepal Airlines Wide-Body case is a devastating indictment of the country's governance institutions. It reveals a systemic vulnerability where:

1. **Laws are optional:** The Public Procurement Act can be bypassed using internal bylaws (Clause 236).  
2. **Oversight is fractured:** The Parliament (PAC) and the Executive (CIAA) worked at cross-purposes, with the CIAA delaying action until political pressure (or protection) shifted.  
3. **Conflict of Interest is normalized:** The appointment of a key suspect (Prem Kumar Rai) to head the very agency investigating the crime (CIAA) is a governance failure of the highest order.

The conviction of foreign nationals and the US DOJ’s fining of AAR Corp demonstrate that the corruption was transnational. However, the inability of Nepal to effectively extradite or enforce sentences against these foreign actors highlights the limitations of its judicial reach.

Conclusion:  
While the Special Court’s verdict in December 2024 delivered a measure of accountability by convicting the bureaucratic executors of the scam, the acquittal of the political architects leaves a gaping hole in justice. The ongoing Supreme Court appeal is critical. If the apex court upholds the principle that Ministers are accountable for the decisions of their ministries, it could reset the precedent for public accountability. Until then, the two Airbus A330s—Annapurna and Makalu—fly as reminders of a deal that promised to take Nepal to the world but instead dragged its governance reputation into the ground.
