## 1. Background Summary (TO VERIFY, CORRECT, AND EXPAND)

Treat the following as a **hypothesis**, not as established fact.  
Your first task is to **verify, correct, and enrich** this narrative using reliable, citable sources (official documents, reputable media, investigation reports, etc.). If something is wrong or incomplete, explicitly correct it in your final output.

> The case involves significant corruption and procedural irregularities in the 2017 procurement of two Airbus A330-200 wide-body aircraft by Nepal's national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC). The deal was valued at approximately $209.6 million, marking it as the largest procurement in Nepal's aviation history.
>
> Key investigations, notably by a parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in 2018, revealed that NAC breached the Public Procurement Act. Instead of purchasing new aircraft directly from the manufacturer, Airbus, NAC procured used aircraft (with 1,000 flight hours) through a complex chain of intermediaries. This involved a US-based company, AAR Corp, which led a consortium that created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in Ireland named HiFly X Ireland Ltd to handle the transaction, a move that critics argued was designed to obscure transparency and inflate costs.
>
> A central allegation was that NAC officials altered aircraft specifications post-bidding. The initial Request for Proposal (RFP) was for aircraft with a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 242 tonnes. However, NAC accepted planes with a lower MTOW of 230 tonnes without a corresponding price reduction. The PAC's report concluded this discrepancy alone led to massive financial losses, estimating the total irregularity at Rs 4.35 billion.
>
> Following the PAC's recommendation, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched its own investigation. On April 4, 2024, the CIAA filed a formal corruption case at the Special Court against 32 individuals and two firms, claiming a lower but still substantial corruption amount of Rs 1.47 billion (approx. $13.39 million). The accused included former ministers, high-ranking bureaucrats, NAC officials, and foreign suppliers.
>
> On December 5, 2024, the Special Court delivered its verdict, convicting key figures including former NAC Managing Director Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former Tourism Secretary Shankar Prasad Adhikari, and several foreign nationals representing the supplier companies. The court upheld the CIAA's claimed loss of Rs 1.47 billion and acquitted 21 individuals, including former Tourism Minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi.

## 2. Research Objectives

When you browse and analyze sources, focus on:

1. **Fact-checking & refining the narrative**
   - Confirm dates, money amounts, names, institutions, and sequence of events.
   - Flag any conflicting accounts across sources and explain the discrepancies.

2. **Timeline reconstruction**
   - From NAC’s decision to procure wide-body aircraft to:
     - PAC investigations and report(s)
     - CIAA investigation and filing
     - Special Court filing and verdict
   - Use specific dates wherever possible (YYYY-MM-DD).

3. **Actor & entity mapping**
   - Public officials (ministers, secretaries, NAC board, NAC management, PAC, CIAA officials).
   - Private companies and intermediaries (AAR Corp, HiFly X Ireland Ltd, others).
   - For each: role, position at the time, and alleged involvement.

4. **Legal & policy framework**
   - Identify applicable laws, regulations and procurement rules.
   - Summarize how investigators and courts say they were breached (or not).

5. **Procurement & financial analysis**
   - Describe the procurement route (direct vs intermediaries/SPV).
   - Explain the MTOW issue, aircraft age/flight hours, pricing, and how the claimed losses were calculated (e.g., PAC vs CIAA figures).

6. **Accountability outcomes**
   - Who was charged, who was convicted, who was acquitted?
   - Penalties: prison, fines, compensation, bans, etc.
   - Note any appeals or pending legal steps, if available.

7. **Information gaps & controversies**
   - Identify key gaps, disputed facts, or open questions.
