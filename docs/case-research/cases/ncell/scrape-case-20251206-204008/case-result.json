  "title": "Ncell Share Sale Controversy (2023)",
  "description": "<p>The case concerns the sale of an 80% stake in <strong>Ncell Axiata Limited</strong>, Nepal's largest private telecommunications company, by Malaysian conglomerate <strong>Axiata Group Berhad</strong>. On December 1, 2023, Axiata announced it sold its holding company, Reynolds Holding Limited, to <strong>Spectrolite UK Limited</strong> for USD 50 million. This valuation sparked controversy as it was a fraction of the <strong>USD 1.365 billion</strong> Axiata paid for the same stake in 2016.</p><p>The primary allegations revolve around a deliberate undervaluation to evade significant capital gains tax and a failure to obtain prior approval from the <strong>Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA)</strong> as required by Nepal's Telecommunications Act. The deal's structure, involving an offshore holding company, and the drastic price reduction raised immediate red flags regarding financial transparency and regulatory compliance.</p><p>Independent Member of Parliament, <strong>Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh</strong>, publicly accused high-level political figures, including Prime Minister <strong>Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'</strong> and his daughter <strong>Ganga Dahal</strong>, of facilitating the deal in exchange for bribes. These accusations were made in parliament and amplified through a writ petition filed at the Supreme Court to halt the transaction.</p><p>In response to public and parliamentary pressure, the Government of Nepal formed a high-level probe committee. The committee's report, submitted in January 2024, concluded the deal was <strong>'unnatural'</strong> and not conducted at an 'Arm's Length Principle', suggesting the seller imposed unusual conditions and retained future benefits. Following these findings, the NTA announced on March 28, 2024, that it could not approve the share purchase agreement in its current form.</p><p>Axiata Group defended its exit by citing an unfavorable business environment in Nepal, including 'unfair taxation and regulatory uncertainties'. This claim was later dismissed as 'baseless' by the government's probe committee.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>This section contains claims and allegations from various sources that are either speculative, lack definitive proof, or represent a particular viewpoint.</p><ul><li>The specific accusation by Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh that Ganga Dahal, the Prime Minister's daughter, facilitated the sale after <strong>'taking a big amount of money'</strong> has not been substantiated with evidence.</li><li>The Prime Minister's secretariat has publicly dismissed Dr. Singh's allegations as 'baseless' and a political 'bargaining chip'.</li><li>Public speculation, as noted in some reports, suggests that the government initially formed the probe committee primarily to defuse public anger rather than to conduct a genuine investigation, with concerns that the involvement of the PM's daughter would lead to a cover-up.</li><li>There have been unsourced allegations that Ncell has a history of using its financial influence to sway media coverage in its favor. One claim mentioned a major daily newspaper, which was allegedly struggling financially, suddenly publishing articles favorable to Ncell. The newspaper was not named.</li></ul>",
