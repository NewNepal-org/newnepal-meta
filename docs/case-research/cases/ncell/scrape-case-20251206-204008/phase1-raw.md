### Raw Findings on Ncell Share Sale Controversy

This report compiles information from provided documents and publicly available sources regarding the controversial sale of Ncell shares by Axiata Group.

#### **1. Case Description**
<p>The case revolves around the sale of an 80% stake in Ncell Axiata Limited, Nepal's largest private telecommunications company, by the Malaysian conglomerate Axiata Group Berhad. In December 2023, Axiata announced the sale of its holding company, Reynolds Holding Limited, to Spectrolite UK Limited for a surprisingly low price, sparking widespread controversy and allegations of corruption, tax evasion, and illicit political influence. The transaction's valuation, at approximately USD 50 million (around Rs. 6.5 billion), stood in stark contrast to the USD 1.365 billion (approx. Rs. 143 billion) Axiata paid for the same stake in 2016, leading to suspicions of a deliberate undervaluation to avoid capital gains tax and other liabilities. The deal was reportedly conducted without prior approval from Nepalese regulatory bodies, particularly the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), as required by law.</p>
<p>Allegations have been publicly raised, most notably by independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh, implicating high-level political figures, including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his daughter Ganga Dahal, in facilitating the deal. In response to the public outcry and pressure from parliamentary committees, the Government of Nepal formed a high-level probe committee in December 2023 to investigate the transaction. The committee's report, submitted in January 2024, found the deal to be "unnatural" and not based on the Arm's Length Principle, suggesting the seller imposed unusual conditions and retained future benefits. Subsequently, the NTA decided it could not approve the share purchase agreement in its current form.</p>
