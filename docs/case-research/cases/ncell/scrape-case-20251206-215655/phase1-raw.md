### Raw Research Findings: Ncell Share Sale Controversy

#### Case Summary

The case involves the sale of an 80% stake in Ncell Axiata Limited, a major Nepali telecommunications provider, by the Malaysian conglomerate Axiata Group Berhad. The stake, held through Axiata's subsidiary Reynolds Holding Limited, was sold to Spectrolite UK Limited, a company owned by Satish Lal Acharya, a businessman of Nepali origin. The transaction, announced in late 2023, has generated significant controversy due to the drastically low sale price, which has led to allegations of a scheme to evade Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and suspicions of collusion involving high-level political figures. This follows a history of tax disputes related to Ncell, most notably the 2016 acquisition by Axiata from Telia Sonera.

#### Key Entities and Individuals

*   **Companies:**
    *   **Ncell Axiata Limited:** The Nepali telecommunications company at the center of the controversy.
    *   **Axiata Group Berhad:** The Malaysian conglomerate that sold its 80% stake in Ncell.
    *   **Spectrolite UK Limited:** The UK-based company that purchased the 80% stake. It was reportedly newly registered before the sale.
    *   **Reynolds Holdings Limited:** A St. Kitts and Nevis-registered holding company, owned by Axiata, which held the 80% stake in Ncell. The sale was technically of Reynolds Holdings.
    *   **Telia Sonera (now Telia Company):** The previous Swedish-Norwegian owner of Ncell, which sold its stake to Axiata in 2016.
    *   **Sunivera Capital Venture:** The company holding the remaining 20% of Ncell shares, reportedly owned by Bhavana Singh Shrestha, the wife of Satish Lal Acharya.

*   **Individuals:**
    *   **Satish Lal Acharya:** The owner of Spectrolite UK, a businessman of Nepali origin based in Singapore. His wife, Bhavana Singh Shrestha, owns the other 20% of Ncell.
    *   **Pushpa Kamal Dahal ('Prachanda'):** The Prime Minister of Nepal. His daughter has been directly implicated, and his government has been criticized for its handling of the situation.
    *   **Ganga Dahal:** Daughter of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. She is accused of facilitating the sale in exchange for a large sum of money.
    *   **Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh:** An independent lawmaker who has been the most vocal critic, publicly accusing Ganga Dahal and the government of facilitating tax evasion.
    *   **Krishna Bahadur Mahara:** Former Finance Minister, who was accused of helping Axiata with tax avoidance during the 2016 Ncell acquisition.
    *   **Tanka Mani Sharma Dangal:** Former Auditor General who was appointed to lead a high-level government committee to probe the sale.

#### Financials and Allegations

*   **2016 Acquisition:** Axiata purchased its 80% stake in Ncell from Telia Sonera for **Rs. 143 billion** (approximately US $1.365 billion).
*   **2023 Sale:** Axiata sold the same 80% stake to Spectrolite UK for **US $50 million** (approximately Rs. 6.5 - 6.65 billion). This represents a sale at roughly 4.65% of the original purchase price.
*   **Primary Allegation:** The core of the scandal is the claim that the shares were deliberately and drastically undervalued in the 2023 sale to evade a significant Capital Gains Tax (CGT) liability.
*   **Political Involvement:** There are strong allegations that the deal was approved by "powerful politicians." Specifically, lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh has accused the Prime Minister's daughter, Ganga Dahal, of facilitating the corrupt deal. The Prime Minister's secretariat has denied these claims as baseless.
*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** The sale was reportedly conducted without prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), which is a violation of Telecommunications Regulations that require approval for share transfers of more than 5%.

#### Timeline of Events

*   **2016:**
    *   Axiata acquires an 80% stake in Ncell from Telia Sonera for $1.365 billion.
    *   A major controversy erupts over Capital Gains Tax evasion, with Telia Sonera leaving the country without paying. The liability was eventually pushed to the buyer, Axiata.
    *   Then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Finance Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara are accused of helping in tax avoidance.
    *   The Large Taxpayer's Office initially determines a tax liability of around Rs. 61 billion.

*   **2019-2023 (Historical Tax Dispute):**
    *   **February 2019:** Nepal's Supreme Court rules that Axiata and Ncell are responsible for paying the CGT from the 2016 sale.
    *   **May 2019:** Axiata files a case against Nepal at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), claiming the tax violates the Nepal-UK Bilateral Investment Treaty.
    *   **April 2020:** Ncell settles a total of Rs. 47 billion in CGT, and the Large Taxpayers Office (LTPO) confirms no further taxes are due for the 2016 transaction.
    *   **January 2021:** The LTPO assesses a further Rs. 57.9 billion tax on Ncell for the same transaction, which Ncell disputes in the Supreme Court.
    *   **June 2023:** The ICSID tribunal rules in favor of Axiata, stating Nepal should refrain from demanding further tax related to the 2016 transaction.

*   **Late 2023 (Current Controversy):**
    *   **December 1, 2023:** Axiata announces an agreement to sell its 80% stake (held via Reynolds Holdings) to Spectrolite UK for US $50 million, citing an unsustainable business environment, unfair taxation, and regulatory uncertainty in Nepal.
    *   **December 3, 2023:** Independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh holds a press conference, alleging the sale is a scheme to evade CGT and implicates Nepali political figures.
    *   **December 7, 2023:** The Nepali government forms a five-member high-level probe committee, led by former Auditor General Tanka Mani Sharma, to investigate the sale.
    *   **December 8, 2023:** Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh files a writ petition at the Supreme Court seeking to halt the sale, naming the Prime Minister's Office and other government bodies as respondents.
    *   **December 19, 2023:** Prime Minister Dahal tells the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee that the government views the sale as "unusual" and is awaiting the probe committee's report. Parliamentary committees, including the Public Accounts Committee, also launch their own inquiries.

*   **2024:**
    *   **January 29, 2024:** The Tanka Mani Sharma-led probe committee submits its report to the Prime Minister.
    *   **January 30, 2024:** News emerges that the committee's report recommends the government not approve the sale in its current form, citing the failure of both parties to seek prior regulatory approval and that the deal does not follow the "arm's length principle."
    *   **Later in 2024 (Date TBC):** The Supreme Court dismisses the writ petition filed by Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh but issues a directive order to the NTA and government to ensure transparency and mandatory prior approval for such transactions in the future.

#### Unverified Information and Additional Details

*   **Allegations of Media Influence:** The initial source document alleges that Ncell, having a history of tax evasion, might be spending money on media outlets to generate favorable coverage. It claims a "big daily, which is said to have been unable to pay its employees, has already started writing news in the favour of Ncell."
*   **Motive of the Accuser:** The Prime Minister's secretariat has publicly stated that Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh's accusations are baseless and serve as a "bargaining chip."
*   **Public Perception:** The initial document suggests the public is more inclined to believe the allegations against the government due to a perception of corruption among Maoist leaders.
*   **Details of Sale Agreement:** The sale for US $50 million reportedly includes a payment of $5 million within six months and the remainder after 48 months. The deal also includes a conditional consideration based on Ncell's future performance until 2029.
