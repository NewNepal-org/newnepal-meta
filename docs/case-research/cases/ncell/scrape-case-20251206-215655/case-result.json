  "title": "Ncell Share Sale and Capital Gains Tax Evasion Allegations (2023)",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the controversial sale of an 80% stake in Nepal's leading telecommunications provider, Ncell Axiata Limited, by its Malaysian parent company, Axiata Group Berhad. The stake, held through the St. Kitts and Nevis-registered company Reynolds Holding Limited, was sold to Spectrolite UK Limited for <strong>US $50 million</strong> on December 1, 2023.</p><p>The transaction sparked immediate public and political outcry due to the extremely low valuation. Axiata had originally purchased the same stake in 2016 from Telia Sonera for <strong>US $1.365 billion</strong> (approximately Rs. 143 billion), making the 2023 sale price less than 5% of its acquisition cost. This has led to widespread allegations that the deal was structured to deliberately undervalue the asset to evade significant Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in Nepal.</p><p>The controversy is compounded by several key factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Political Allegations:</strong> Independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh publicly accused high-level political figures, specifically Ganga Dahal, the daughter of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, of facilitating the deal in exchange for personal gain. The Prime Minister's Office has denied these claims.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Breach:</strong> The sale was executed without the mandatory prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), a violation of Section 27 of the Telecommunications Regulations, which requires permission for any transfer of more than 5% of a licensee's shares.</li><li><strong>Government Investigation:</strong> In response to the controversy, the Government of Nepal formed a five-member high-level probe committee led by former Auditor General Tanka Mani Sharma Dangal. The committee's report, submitted in January 2024, recommended that the government not approve the sale, citing the lack of prior regulatory approval and the deal's failure to adhere to the 'arm's length principle' for valuation.</li><li><strong>Legal Action:</strong> Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court to halt the transaction. The court later dismissed the petition but issued a directive to the government and NTA to ensure mandatory prior approval and transparency in all future share sale transactions.</li></ul><p>The case echoes the 2016 Ncell sale, which was also mired in a years-long dispute over CGT, eventually leading to an international arbitration case that Axiata won against the Government of Nepal.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information consists of allegations, unconfirmed reports, and details that have not been officially verified:</p><ul><li><strong>Allegations of Media Influence:</strong> There are claims that Ncell may be influencing media coverage to portray the deal favorably. One report suggested a major daily newspaper, allegedly facing financial difficulties, began publishing pro-Ncell articles after the controversy broke.</li><li><strong>Motive of the Accuser:</strong> The Prime Minister's secretariat has publicly dismissed Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh's accusations, suggesting they are a 'bargaining chip' and lack substance.</li><li><strong>Specific Payment Terms:</strong> The sale agreement for US $50 million reportedly includes an initial payment of $5 million within six months, with the remaining balance to be paid over 48 months. The deal is also said to include a conditional consideration based on Ncell's business performance up to 2029.</li></ul>",
