## Ncell Share Sale Controversy (2023)

**Case ID:** NPL-2023-001
**Status:** Under Investigation
**Date of Incident:** 2023-12-01

### Description

<p>In December 2023, Malaysian conglomerate Axiata Group Berhad announced the sale of its 80% stake in Nepal's second-largest telecommunications company, Ncell Axiata Limited. The stake was sold to Spectrlite UK Limited, a UK-registered company owned by Satish Lal Acharya, a Singapore-based businessman of Nepali origin. The declared sale price of $50 million sparked immediate controversy and public outcry, as Axiata had purchased the same stake in 2016 for $1.365 billion.</p><p>The deal is shrouded in allegations of a massive tax evasion scheme, political corruption, and a deliberate attempt to circumvent Nepalese law, which could see Ncell's ownership transferred to the state upon its license expiry in 2029. The transaction was executed without the legally required prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA). The controversy involves high-profile political figures, including allegations against the daughter of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and has led to multiple investigations by parliamentary committees and a government-appointed high-level probe committee.</p>

### Facts

<p>This section outlines the verified facts of the case, based on public records and credible news sources.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Transaction:</strong> On December 1, 2023, Axiata Group Berhad entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to sell Reynolds Holding Limited, the entity that owns an 80% equity stake in Ncell, to Spectrlite UK Limited. The remaining 20% of Ncell is owned by Sunivera Capital Venture Pvt. Ltd., a company owned by Bhavana Singh Shrestha, the wife of Spectrlite UK's owner, Satish Lal Acharya. This effectively transfers 100% ownership of Ncell to the Acharya family.</li>
    <li><strong>Price Discrepancy:</strong> Axiata sold its 80% stake for a fixed consideration of $50 million (approx. Rs 6.5 billion). This is a fraction of the $1.365 billion (approx. Rs 143 billion) Axiata paid to acquire the same stake from Swedish company TeliaSonera in 2016.</li>
    <li><strong>Buyer's Profile:</strong> The buyer, Spectrlite UK Limited, was registered in the United Kingdom on September 26, 2023, shortly before the deal. It is owned by Satish Lal Acharya. A government probe committee later found the company had a nominal share capital and lacked the necessary financial, technical, or managerial capacity to purchase and operate Ncell.</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Regulatory Approval:</strong> The sale was conducted without prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), which is a legal requirement under the Telecommunications Regulation 1998 and NTA Bylaws for the sale of more than 5% of a licensed entity's shares.</li>
    <li><strong>Government Investigation:</strong> On December 7, 2023, the Government of Nepal formed a five-member high-level committee, chaired by former Auditor General Tanka Mani Sharma, to investigate the transaction. The committee submitted its report to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on January 29, 2024.</li>
    <li><strong>Probe Committee Findings:</strong> The Tanka Mani Sharma committee's report concluded that the Ncell sale was "unnatural" and not conducted at arm's length. It recommended the government not approve the deal in its current form. The report found that Axiata's justification for the sale—an unfavorable business climate—was baseless, as Ncell had earned over Rs 100 billion in profit and repatriated over Rs 68 billion since 2016. The committee also noted the buyer, Spectrlite UK, was not qualified to operate Ncell and that the deal's structure, where the seller retained benefits for years, was highly suspect.</li>
    <li><strong>Parliamentary and Legal Actions:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple parliamentary committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Finance Committee, and State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, launched separate inquiries into the deal.</li>
            <li>The Patan High Court issued an interim order to halt the share sale process.</li>
            <li>Independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court to stop the transaction. The court ultimately dismissed the petition but issued a directive to the NTA to enforce the law and to Ncell to operate transparently and legally.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Historical Context of Tax Evasion:</strong> Ncell has a history of tax-related controversies. The 2016 sale from TeliaSonera to Axiata was mired in a major capital gains tax (CGT) evasion scandal. The tax was eventually paid after a Supreme Court order. Axiata later filed a case against Nepal at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) over the tax dispute, which it lost in June 2023.</li>

### Allegations

*   **Tax Evasion:** The primary allegation is that the 80% stake was deliberately and drastically undervalued—sold for $50 million after being bought for $1.365 billion—to evade a significant amount of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in Nepal.
*   **Political Corruption:** Independent MP Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh publicly alleged that Ganga Dahal, the daughter of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, facilitated the deal in exchange for a large sum of money. He further claimed that powerful politicians received "billions" while the nation stood to lose "trillions".
*   **Circumventing Nationalization:** The sale is seen as a move to prevent Ncell's assets from being transferred to the Government of Nepal. According to the Telecommunications Act, a telecommunication company with over 50% foreign investment would come under government ownership after its 25-year license expires in 2029. By transferring ownership to a company owned by a person of Nepali origin, Ncell might avoid this provision.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** The deal was conducted opaquely and without informing or seeking prior approval from the regulatory body, the NTA, in violation of Nepali law.
