  "title": "Ncell Share Sale Controversy (2023)",
  "description": "<p>In a highly controversial transaction on <strong>December 1, 2023</strong>, Malaysian conglomerate <strong>Axiata Group Berhad</strong> announced the sale of its 80% majority stake in Nepal's second-largest telecommunications company, Ncell Axiata Limited. The stake was sold to <strong>Spectrlite UK Limited</strong>, a newly formed UK-based company owned by Satish Lal Acharya, for <strong>$50 million</strong>.</p><p>The deal immediately sparked public and political outrage due to the immense price discrepancy; Axiata had purchased the same stake in 2016 for <strong>$1.365 billion</strong>. This has led to widespread allegations of a major tax evasion scheme, political corruption, and a strategic maneuver to circumvent Nepali law. Under the Telecommunications Act, Ncell's assets are expected to be transferred to the state upon the expiry of its license in 2029, a provision the sale could potentially undermine.</p><p>Key issues in the case include:<ul><li><strong>Lack of Regulatory Approval:</strong> The transaction was executed without the legally required prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA).</li><li><strong>Questionable Buyer:</strong> A government probe found that the buyer, Spectrlite UK, was a shell company with nominal capital, lacking the financial or managerial capacity to operate Ncell.</li><li><strong>Government and Parliamentary Investigations:</strong> The Government of Nepal formed a high-level probe committee led by former Auditor General Tanka Mani Sharma. The committee's report, submitted on January 29, 2024, deemed the sale 'unnatural' and recommended that the government not approve it. Multiple parliamentary committees also launched separate investigations.</li><li><strong>Legal Challenges:</strong> A writ petition was filed at the Supreme Court to halt the sale. While the petition was eventually dismissed, the court issued a directive ordering the NTA and Ncell to comply strictly with Nepali laws.</li></ul></p><p>Following the investigations, on March 28, 2024, the NTA formally decided it could not approve the share purchase agreement in its current form, effectively halting the deal.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The specific amount of money allegedly received by <strong>Ganga Dahal</strong>, daughter of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as claimed by Member of Parliament Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh, has not been substantiated with evidence. Dr. Singh alleged she facilitated the deal for a large bribe but stated he would present evidence at a later, appropriate time.</p><p>The Prime Minister's Office has officially denied these allegations as 'baseless' and stated that no meetings or conversations, formal or informal, took place between the PM's office and Ncell representatives regarding the sale.</p>",
