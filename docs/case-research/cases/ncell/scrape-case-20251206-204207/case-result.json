  "title": "Ncell Share Sale and Tax Evasion Controversy (2023)",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the controversial sale of an <strong>80% stake in Ncell Axiata Limited</strong> by its Malaysian parent company, Axiata Group Berhad, to Spectrolite UK Limited. The deal, announced on December 1, 2023, has drawn significant scrutiny and allegations of corruption due to its financial terms and regulatory procedure.</p><p>Key aspects of the controversy include:</p><ul><li><strong>Drastic Undervaluation:</strong> Axiata, which purchased the stake for <strong>$1.365 billion (approx. NPR 143 billion)</strong> in 2016, sold it for only <strong>$50 million</strong>. This more than 95% reduction in value has been labeled \"unrealistic\" and is alleged to be a maneuver to evade substantial capital gains tax liabilities in Nepal.</li><li><strong>Allegations of Political Corruption:</strong> Independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh publicly accused Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' and his daughter, Ganga Dahal, of facilitating the undervalued sale in exchange for illicit payments. The Prime Minister has denied these claims, calling them baseless.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Non-compliance:</strong> The sale was reportedly executed without prior approval from the <strong>Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA)</strong>. The Telecommunications Regulation 1997 requires NTA approval for any sale or purchase involving more than 5% of a licensee's paid-up capital.</li><li><strong>Government and Parliamentary Response:</strong> In response to the public outcry, the Government of Nepal formed a high-level probe committee on December 7, 2023, which submitted its report on January 29, 2024. Simultaneously, parliamentary bodies, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), initiated their own investigations and directed the government to halt the sale process pending a thorough review.</li><li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> This incident echoes the 2016 Ncell ownership transfer from Telia Sonera to Axiata, which was also embroiled in a major tax evasion scandal that was only resolved after a Supreme Court ruling.</li></ul><p>The buyer, Spectrolite UK, is owned by Satish Lal Acharya, a Singapore-based individual of Nepali origin. His family now effectively controls 100% of Ncell, as the remaining 20% is owned by his wife.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The most serious unverified allegations center on claims made by lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh. He has stated publicly and in parliamentary committee meetings that he has evidence of bribery.</p><ul><li>Dr. Singh alleged that <strong>Ganga Dahal</strong>, daughter and personal secretary of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, received a \"big amount of money\" to facilitate the questionable Ncell share sale. He claimed, \"I know with whom and why Ganga Dahal... received money. I have evidence, and at the right time, I will take it to the public and media.\"</li><li>The Prime Minister's secretariat has refuted these claims, stating that Singh's argument was a \"bargaining chip.\"</li></ul><p>While these allegations have been widely reported and are central to the political dimension of the scandal, the purported evidence has not been publicly produced or verified through an official investigation.</p>",
