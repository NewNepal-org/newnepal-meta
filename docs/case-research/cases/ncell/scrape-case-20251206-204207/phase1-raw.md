### **Raw Research Findings: Ncell Share Sale Controversy**

#### **1. Summary of Allegations**

The central issue is the sale of an 80% stake in Ncell by its Malaysian parent company, Axiata, to Spectrolite UK Limited, a company owned by Satish Lal Acharya. The deal, announced around December 1, 2023, is contentious due to the drastically low sale price and the alleged circumvention of Nepali regulatory processes, sparking accusations of high-level political corruption intended to evade capital gains tax.

*   **Undervaluation for Tax Evasion:** Axiata purchased the 80% stake in 2016 for approximately Rs. 143 billion ($1.365 billion USD). It sold the same stake for only about Rs. 6.5-6.65 billion ($50 million USD), a reduction of over 95%. Critics and politicians allege this low valuation is an "unbelievable" and "unrealistic" tactic designed to evade significant capital gains tax.
*   **Political Corruption:** Independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh has publicly accused Ganga Dahal, daughter of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, of facilitating the undervalued sale in exchange for a "big amount of money". These allegations were made in public statements, on social media, and within a meeting of the House of Representatives' State Management and Good Governance Committee. Prime Minister Dahal himself is also accused of direct involvement.
*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** The deal was reportedly executed without prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA), a violation of Telecommunications Regulation 1997, which requires NTA approval for the sale or purchase of more than 5% of a licensee's paid-up capital. The NTA was not formally informed before the sale announcement.
*   **Historical Precedent:** This event is viewed in the context of Ncell's controversial 2016 ownership transfer from Telia Sonera to Axiata, which was also mired in a major tax evasion scandal amounting to billions of rupees. The tax from that deal was only paid after a Supreme Court order. Then-Finance Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara was accused of assisting in tax avoidance at the time.

#### **2. Key Individuals, Companies, and Entities**

*   **Axiata Group Berhad:** The Malaysian telecommunications conglomerate that owned 80% of Ncell through its subsidiary Reynolds Holding Limited. It has since sold this stake, citing an unsustainable business environment in Nepal due to "unfair taxation and regulatory uncertainties".
*   **Ncell Axiata Limited:** The Nepal-based mobile service provider at the center of the controversy.
*   **Spectrolite UK Limited:** The UK-based buyer of Axiata's 80% stake. The company was newly registered in September 2023, just months before the deal.
*   **Satish Lal Acharya:** The owner of Spectrolite UK, described as a person of Nepali origin based in Singapore. His family now effectively controls 100% of Ncell, as his wife owns the other 20%. Prime Minister Dahal has acknowledged knowing Acharya, who hosted him in Singapore during his late wife's medical treatment.
*   **Ganga Dahal:** Daughter of the Prime Minister and his personal secretary. She is accused by Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh of facilitating the deal and receiving bribes.
*   **Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda':** The Prime Minister of Nepal. He is accused of involvement in the deal. He has denied the allegations, calling them baseless and an attack on democracy.

*   **Krishna Bahadur Mahara:** Former Finance Minister, who was implicated in controversy during the 2016 Ncell tax evasion scandal.
*   **Government Probe Committee:** A five-member high-level committee formed by the government on December 7, 2023, to investigate the share sale. It is headed by former Auditor General Tanka Mani Sharma Dangal. The committee submitted its report to the Prime Minister on January 29, 2024.
*   **Parliamentary Committees:** Several House of Representatives committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Finance Committee, have launched their own investigations into the matter. The PAC directed the government to halt the sale process pending a detailed investigation.
