  "title": "Ncell Share Sale Controversy (2023)",
  "description": "<p>In a highly controversial transaction on December 1, 2023, Malaysian conglomerate <strong>Axiata Group Berhad</strong> announced the sale of its 80% stake in Nepal's largest private telecom operator, Ncell Axiata Limited. The stake was sold to <strong>Spectrolite UK Limited</strong>, a UK-based company owned by Satish Lal Acharya, a Singapore-based businessman of Nepali origin.</p><p>The deal triggered widespread outrage and scrutiny due to the exceptionally low sale price. Axiata sold its controlling share for a mere <strong>US$50 million</strong>, a fraction of the <strong>US$1.365 billion</strong> it paid to acquire the same stake from Swedish company TeliaSonera in 2016. This massive discrepancy led to serious allegations of a deliberate scheme to evade Capital Gains Tax (CGT).</p><p>The key allegations are:</p><ul><li><strong>Tax Evasion:</strong> The primary claim is that the transaction was intentionally undervalued to avoid paying significant capital gains tax to the Government of Nepal.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Circumvention:</strong> The deal was executed without seeking prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), a violation of Nepal's Telecommunications Act.</li><li><strong>Political Corruption:</strong> Accusations surfaced implicating high-level political figures in facilitating the dubious sale. Independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh publicly accused <strong>Ganga Dahal</strong>, daughter and personal secretary of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', of accepting a large sum of money to enable the deal.</li></ul><p>This controversy revived memories of Ncell's previous tax evasion scandal following the 2016 sale, where Axiata itself was ultimately held liable by the Supreme Court for CGT that the seller, TeliaSonera, failed to pay. In response to the 2023 deal, the Government of Nepal formed a high-level probe committee led by former Auditor General <strong>Tanka Mani Sharma Dangal</strong>. Multiple parliamentary committees also launched parallel investigations, and the Patan High Court issued an order to temporarily halt the sale.</p><p>Leaked findings from the Sharma committee's report, submitted in January 2024, concluded that the sale was unlawful, Axiata's stated reasons for exiting Nepal were baseless, and the buyer, Spectrolite UK, lacked the financial and technical capacity to operate Ncell.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is based on public allegations and media reports but has not been officially confirmed or fully substantiated:</p><ul><li>The exact amount of the alleged bribe paid to <strong>Ganga Dahal</strong> has not been specified, only referred to as a 'big amount' in public accusations.</li><li>The full, official report from the Tanka Mani Sharma-led probe committee has not been publicly released by the government. All detailed findings available to the public come from <strong>media leaks</strong> of the report.</li><li>While Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' has been linked to the controversy through his daughter's alleged involvement and his acknowledged acquaintance with the buyer, there is <strong>no direct, verified evidence</strong> of his personal financial gain or direct involvement in the 2023 transaction.</li><li>It was reported by People's Review that a 'big daily' newspaper, allegedly facing financial trouble, began publishing news favorable to Ncell, but the specific publication was not named.</li></ul>",
