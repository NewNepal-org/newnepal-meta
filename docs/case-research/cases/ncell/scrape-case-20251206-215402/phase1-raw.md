### **Ncell Share Sale Controversy (2023)**

#### **Case ID:** NCELL-2023-SALE

#### **Date of Initiation:** 2023-12-01

#### **Status:** Under Investigation

### **Description**
<p>In December 2023, a significant controversy emerged when Malaysian company <strong>Axiata Group Berhad</strong> announced the sale of its 80% stake in Nepal's largest private telecommunications provider, Ncell Axiata Limited. The stake, held through a subsidiary named Reynolds Holding Limited, was sold to <strong>Spectrolite UK Limited</strong>, a UK-registered company owned by Satish Lal Acharya, a Singapore-based businessman of Nepali origin.</p>
<p>The deal immediately drew widespread criticism and suspicion due to the dramatically low sale price. Axiata sold its 80% share for a fixed consideration of just <strong>US$50 million (approximately Rs 6.5 billion)</strong>, whereas it had acquired the same stake in 2016 from the Swedish-Finnish company TeliaSonera for <strong>US$1.365 billion (approximately Rs 143 billion)</strong>. This vast discrepancy led to allegations that the transaction was deliberately undervalued to evade capital gains tax and to circumvent regulatory requirements. The timing was also noted as suspicious, as Ncell's license is set to expire in 2029, after which ownership could potentially be transferred to the state.</p>
<p>The controversy is compounded by Ncell's history of tax disputes, particularly the major capital gains tax evasion scandal following the 2016 sale from TeliaSonera to Axiata. Allegations of political corruption have also surfaced, with high-level figures, including the Prime Minister's daughter, being accused of facilitating the deal. In response to public and political pressure, the Government of Nepal and multiple parliamentary committees launched investigations into the transaction.</p>

### **Facts and Allegations**

**Transaction Details:**
<ul>
    <li><strong>Seller:</strong> Axiata Group Berhad (Malaysia), through its subsidiary Reynolds Holding Limited.</li>
    <li><strong>Buyer:</strong> Spectrolite UK Limited, a company registered in the UK in September 2023 with a nominal share capital that was later increased to $100,000.</li>
    <li><strong>Asset Sold:</strong> 80% equity stake in Ncell Axiata Limited.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Price (2016):</strong> US$1.365 billion.</li>
    <li><strong>Sale Price (2023):</strong> US$50 million fixed consideration ($5 million payable within six months and the rest within 48 months), plus a conditional amount based on future performance.</li>
</ul>

**Allegations of Wrongdoing:**
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tax Evasion:</strong> The primary allegation is that the shares were sold at an artificially low price to evade capital gains tax.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory Evasion:</strong> The deal was allegedly conducted without prior approval from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), the country's regulatory body, as required by law. A high-level probe committee later concluded that neither the buyer nor the seller sought the necessary permissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Corruption:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent lawmaker Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh publicly accused <strong>Ganga Dahal</strong>, daughter and personal secretary of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', of facilitating the sale in exchange for a large sum of money.</li>
            <li>The Prime Minister's secretariat denied the allegations, calling them baseless and a "bargaining chip".</li>
            <li>Prime Minister Dahal acknowledged knowing Satish Lal Acharya but denied any improper benefit resulted from their acquaintance.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Historical Precedent of Tax Avoidance:</strong> The 2023 controversy is linked to the 2016 Ncell sale, where TeliaSonera sold its stake to Axiata. That deal resulted in a prolonged dispute over an unpaid capital gains tax of approximately Rs 66 billion. Then-Finance Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara was accused of helping in tax avoidance at the time. The Supreme Court of Nepal eventually ruled that the buyer (Axiata) was liable for the tax if the seller (TeliaSonera) did not pay it.</li>
</ul>

**Government and Parliamentary Response:**
<ul>
    <li>A five-member high-level probe committee, led by former Auditor General <strong>Tanka Mani Sharma Dangal</strong>, was formed by the government on December 7, 2023, to investigate the sale.</li>
    <li>Several parliamentary bodies, including the Public Accounts Committee, Finance Committee, and the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, also initiated their own inquiries.</li>
    <li>The Patan High Court issued an interlocutory interim order to halt the sale pending further review.</li>
</ul>
