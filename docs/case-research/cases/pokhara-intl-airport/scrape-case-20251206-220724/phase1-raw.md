### Pokhara International Airport Corruption Case: Raw Findings

#### **Case Overview**
The case involves allegations of large-scale corruption and financial irregularities in the construction of Pokhara International Airport (PIA), a project funded by a loan from the Exim Bank of China. A sub-committee of the House of Representatives' Public Accounts Committee (PAC), led by Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) Chairman Rajendra Lingden, conducted an investigation and produced a report in April 2025, concluding that significant embezzlement and procedural lapses occurred throughout the project's lifecycle. The full PAC later endorsed the sub-committee's report and, in May 2025, instructed the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) to conduct a further investigation and take action against those responsible.

**Specific Irregularities:**
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;">
    <p>A sub-committee of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) unearthed numerous irregularities, which were detailed in its 38-page report submitted in April 2025. The full PAC later directed the CIAA to investigate these findings. Key allegations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost Inflation:</strong> The project's cost was allegedly inflated. CAAN's initial estimate was <strong>$145 million</strong>, but the contract was awarded to the Chinese company for <strong>$215.96 million</strong>, an increase of over $70 million, through negotiations that reportedly violated public procurement laws. The Chinese company's lowest bid was even higher, at $305 million.</li>
        <li><strong>Runway and Soil Issues:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A payment of approximately <strong>$5.5 million</strong> was made for transporting soil and pebbles from at least five kilometers away to raise the runway's elevation. The investigation found no evidence that soil was actually brought from outside the site.</li>
                <li>The runway was required to be built at an elevation between 2,677 and 2,674 feet but was constructed at <strong>2,636 feet</strong>, violating the agreement.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Improper Tax Exemptions:</strong> A tax exemption of <strong>NPR 2.22 billion</strong> was granted to the construction company, contrary to the main agreement which stipulated the contractor would bear the tax liabilities. The sub-committee's report described this as "policy-level corruption".</li>
        <li><strong>Unnecessary and Irregular Payments:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NPR 320 million</strong> was paid for cutting 40 meters off the Chhine Danda hill, a task that was reportedly never completed. Other sources cite this amount as NPR 230.2 million for incomplete excavation work.</li>
                <li><strong>$742,000</strong> was improperly spent on an HVAC system.</li>
                <li><strong>$28 million</strong> was spent on consulting services in violation of the agreement.</li>
                <li>Payments totaling <strong>$10.648 million</strong> were allegedly made for runway, taxiway, and drainage construction that was not completed.</li>
                <li>An estimated <strong>$220,000</strong> was misappropriated as the fuel storage facility was not built.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Policy-Level Immunity:</strong> The Ekantipur article highlights that the sub-committee's report did not mention the names or responsibilities of high-level officials and political leadership who made policy decisions regarding the contract process and cost increases, suggesting potential immunity. It specifically notes the absence of the then-Finance Minister Gyanendra Karki, who allegedly directed the tax exemption.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In August 2025, CAAN Director General Pradeep Adhikari held a press conference denying all allegations, calling the sub-committee's report "baseless," "arbitrary," and "exaggerated". He challenged the investigators to prove any corruption and argued that cost increases were due to adding new infrastructure like a boarding bridge, inflation adjustments, and quality enhancements, which were formally approved.</p>

    <p>A sub-committee of the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC), led by Rastriya Prajatantra Party Chairman Rajendra Lingden, concluded in an April 2025 report that there were significant financial irregularities and corruption in the construction of Pokhara International Airport. The report, which was later endorsed by the full PAC and forwarded to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) for further action, alleged embezzlement amounting to approximately <strong>NPR 14 billion</strong>.</p>
    <p>The investigation was initiated in response to widespread concerns about the project, which was built with a loan of around NPR 22 billion from the Exim Bank of China and constructed by China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd.</p>
    <p><strong>Key findings from the sub-committee's report include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost Inflation:</strong> The project's cost was allegedly inflated from an initial CAAN estimate of <strong>$145 million</strong> to a final contract value of <strong>$215.96 million</strong> through negotiations that reportedly violated public procurement laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax Irregularities:</strong> The construction company was granted an improper tax exemption of <strong>NPR 2.22 billion</strong>, which the sub-committee termed "policy-level corruption".</li>
        <li><strong>Irregular Payments:</strong> A payment of <strong>NPR 320 million</strong> was made for cutting down a hill, a task the report claims was never done. Additionally, a payment of approximately <strong>$5.5 million</strong> was made for transporting soil and pebbles that were allegedly never delivered, as the runway was built at a lower elevation (2,636 ft) than specified in the agreement (2,674-2,677 ft).</li>
        <li><strong>Misappropriation of Funds:</strong> The report alleges that payments were made for uncompleted work, including <strong>$10.648 million</strong> for the runway and taxiway and <strong>$742,000</strong> for an HVAC system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The sub-committee recommended the suspension of and investigation into several officials from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), including Director General <strong>Pradeep Adhikari</strong> (who was the airport project chief from 2014-2017), former DGs Sanjiv Gautam and Rajan Pokharel, and project chief Binesh Munakarmi, among others.</p>
    <p>On May 22, 2025, the PAC officially instructed the CIAA to investigate the 15 fundamental questions raised in the report and take action against those found guilty. In August 2025, DG Pradeep Adhikari publicly refuted the allegations, calling the report baseless and challenging the committee to provide proof of corruption. On December 3, 2025, the CIAA arrested Pradeep Adhikari and five others in relation to a separate corruption case concerning the Nalinchowk Heliport.</p>

**unverified_info:**
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;">
    <p>The exact total amount of corruption is subject to varying reports. While the PAC report and several news outlets cite a figure of <strong>NPR 14 billion</strong>, other sources mention <strong>NPR 10 billion</strong> or as high as <strong>NPR 18 billion</strong>. One committee member stated the figure could be higher as the Finance Ministry did not provide all requested documents during the investigation.</p>
    <p>There are also claims that the parliamentary report intentionally omitted the names of high-level political leaders who made policy-level decisions that enabled the corruption, such as then-Finance Minister Gyanendra Karki, who allegedly approved the illegal tax exemptions. This suggests that some decision-makers may have been granted "policy immunity."</p>
    <p>Two members of the sub-committee from the CPN-UML party, Gokul Baskota and Tara Lama Tamang, registered a dissenting opinion on the report, arguing that officials named in the report should have been called for discussion before conclusions were drawn and that a more in-depth study was needed on technical matters.</p>
