  "title": "Pokhara International Airport Construction Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>A sub-committee of the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC), led by Rastriya Prajatantra Party Chairman Rajendra Lingden, concluded in an April 2025 report that there were significant financial irregularities and corruption in the construction of Pokhara International Airport. The report, which was later endorsed by the full PAC and forwarded to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) for further action, alleged embezzlement amounting to approximately <strong>NPR 14 billion</strong>.</p><p>The investigation was initiated in response to widespread concerns about the project, which was built with a loan from the Exim Bank of China and constructed by China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd.</p><p><strong>Key findings from the sub-committee's report include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cost Inflation:</strong> The project's cost was allegedly inflated from an initial Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) estimate of <strong>$145 million</strong> to a final contract value of <strong>$215.96 million</strong> through negotiations that reportedly violated public procurement laws.</li><li><strong>Tax Irregularities:</strong> The construction company was granted an improper tax exemption of <strong>NPR 2.22 billion</strong>, which the sub-committee termed \"policy-level corruption\".</li><li><strong>Irregular Payments & Construction Flaws:</strong> Payments were made for uncompleted or flawed work, including <strong>NPR 320 million</strong> for cutting down a hill (a task the report claims was not done), approximately <strong>$5.5 million</strong> for transporting soil that was never delivered, and construction of the runway at a lower elevation (2,636 ft) than specified in the agreement (2,674-2,677 ft).</li><li><strong>Misappropriation of Funds:</strong> The report alleges that payments were made for other uncompleted items, including <strong>$10.648 million</strong> for the runway and taxiway and <strong>$742,000</strong> for an HVAC system.</li></ul><p>The sub-committee recommended the suspension of and investigation into several officials from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), including Director General <strong>Pradeep Adhikari</strong> (who was the airport project chief from 2014-2017), former DGs Sanjiv Gautam and Rajan Pokharel, and project chief Binesh Munakarmi, among others.</p><p>On May 22, 2025, the PAC officially instructed the CIAA to investigate the issues raised in the report and take action against those found guilty. In August 2025, DG Pradeep Adhikari publicly refuted the allegations, calling the report baseless. On December 3, 2025, the CIAA arrested Pradeep Adhikari and five others in relation to a separate corruption case concerning the Nalinchowk Heliport.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The exact total amount of corruption is subject to varying reports. While some sources cite a figure of <strong>NPR 14 billion</strong>, others mention <strong>NPR 10 billion</strong> or as high as <strong>NPR 18 billion</strong>. A committee member stated the figure could be higher as the Finance Ministry did not provide all requested documents.</p><p>There are also claims that the parliamentary report intentionally omitted the names of high-level political leaders who made policy-level decisions that enabled the alleged corruption, such as then-Finance Minister Gyanendra Karki, who reportedly approved the tax exemptions. This suggests that some decision-makers may have been granted 'policy immunity'.</p><p>Two members of the sub-committee from the CPN-UML party, Gokul Baskota and Tara Lama Tamang, registered a dissenting opinion on the report, arguing that a more in-depth study was needed on technical matters and that named officials should have been consulted before conclusions were drawn.</p>",
