## Case Summary

### Short Description (1-2 sentences)
Nepal's largest corruption case involving the systematic inflation of Pokhara International Airport construction costs by over 40%, resulting in alleged embezzlement of approximately USD 74 million through collusion between Chinese contractor CAMC Engineering and 55 Nepali officials including former ministers and bureaucrats.

### Detailed Description
The Pokhara Regional International Airport (PRIA) project, initially conceived as a transformative infrastructure asset to unlock tourism potential in Western Nepal, has become the most significant corruption scandal in Nepal's aviation history. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has formally charged 55 individuals and China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd. with embezzling approximately USD 74.34 million through a sophisticated scheme of bid-rigging, cost inflation, and certification of fictitious engineering works.

The fraud was structural from inception. The project bypassed competitive bidding through a "government-to-government" deal, with the contract signed before a Detailed Project Report was prepared—allowing the contractor to define its own scope, budget, and timeline. The government's estimate of USD 169.69 million was inflated to a contracted value of USD 215.96 million, eventually reaching approximately USD 244 million.

Key fraudulent activities included: billing USD 5.5 million for soil transport that never occurred (using on-site cut-and-fill instead), USD 10.65 million for incomplete drainage construction, payments for fuel storage and HVAC systems never built, and procurement of equipment at 2-3 times market prices. The contractor was also granted illegal tax exemptions worth NPR 2.22 billion (approximately USD 16.7 million) that should have been paid per contract terms.

The airport, inaugurated January 1, 2023, remains commercially unviable due to severe technical flaws—specifically a runway built 38-41 feet lower than design specifications, causing payload penalties of 5-10 tonnes for standard aircraft. Combined with India's denial of critical airspace routes, the airport generates negligible revenue while Nepal services a USD 215.96 million loan to China Exim Bank.

The case has become a symbol of governance failure and fueled the 2025 youth-led anti-corruption protests that led to Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's resignation and the appointment of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as interim Prime Minister.

## Locations

- **Pokhara, Kaski District**: Location of the airport and primary site of construction fraud
- **Kathmandu**: Location of Special Court where charges filed; headquarters of CAAN and government ministries involved
- **Rithepani Hill, Pokhara**: Site of emergency hill-cutting (40 meters, 600 trees) required due to runway elevation deficiency, costing additional NPR 320 million

---

## Key Allegations

1. **Cost inflation of over 40%**: Project costs deliberately inflated from government estimate of USD 169.69 million to final claimed cost of approximately USD 244 million, with USD 74.34 million identified as embezzled funds.

2. **Bid-rigging and procurement fraud**: Secret MoU signed in 2011 pledging support for CAMC's bid before tender announced; only Chinese firms allowed to bid per loan conditions; contract signed before Detailed Project Report prepared.

3. **Billing for fictitious soil transport**: USD 5.5 million paid for external soil transport from Kotre and Bijayapur rivers that never occurred—contractor used on-site cut-and-fill method instead.

4. **Payment for incomplete/non-existent drainage works**: USD 10.648 million disbursed for drainage construction that was largely non-existent or incomplete.

5. **Payment for unbuilt facilities**: Fuel storage facility and HVAC systems listed as "completed" and paid for but never constructed.

6. **Runway elevation deficiency**: Runway built at 2,636 feet instead of specified 2,674-2,677 feet (38-41 feet lower), reducing soil filling costs for contractor while compromising safety and requiring emergency hill-cutting.

7. **Overpriced equipment procurement**: Air traffic control radar, navigational aids, and lighting systems purchased at 2-3 times global market prices; some systems non-functional upon installation.

8. **Illegal tax exemptions**: NPR 2.22 billion (approximately USD 16.7 million) in tax exemptions granted to CAMC despite contract requiring contractor to pay all applicable taxes.

9. **Conflict of interest in oversight**: CAMC acquired IPPR International Engineering (the project's "independent" consultant) in 2019, eliminating independent oversight.

10. **Academic fraud**: Three Tribhuvan University professors produced "technically baseless" report recommending cost increase to USD 230 million without access to necessary documents.

11. **Consulting budget manipulation**: Consulting budget slashed from USD 2.8 million to just USD 10,000, eliminating Nepal's capacity to supervise the contractor.
