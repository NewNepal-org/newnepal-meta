Billions embezzled in Pokhara airport works, probe finds
Citing CAAN’s oversight of international airport project, lawmakers seek action against its chief, Pradeep Adhikari.

A subpanel of the House of Representatives’ Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has confirmed irregularities and corruption worth billions of rupees in the construction of Pokhara International Airport.

Finalising the draft report nearly 10 months after its formation, the 12-member committee led by Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden has unearthed irregularities and corruption in construction as well as exemption of taxes to the construction companies.

“The corruption and the irregularities amount to around Rs14 billion in the current exchange rate of US dollar,” Prem Ale, a member of the committee, told the Post.

The subpanel has listed out corruption and irregularities in around a dozen issues. The project report suggested that the soil at the construction site was not suitable to build the airport as the runway’s elevation had to be increased. Though nearly $5.5 million was paid to cover the cost of transporting the soil and pebbles to the site from at least five kilometers away, the study has found no soil was brought from outside.

Similarly, the elevation of the runway must be between 2,677 and 2,674 feet above sea level, as per the agreement. Filling of the sand and pebbles was necessary to attain the required elevation. However, the runway was built at 2,636 feet above sea level by going against the agreement, per the study.
