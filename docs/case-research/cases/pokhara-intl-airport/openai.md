# Pokhara International Airport Corruption Scandal (Nepal)

**Summary:** The construction of the Pokhara International Airport -- a
flagship infrastructure project in Nepal financed by a Chinese loan --
has become one of Nepal's largest corruption scandals. Over a decade of
planning and building, costs were **deliberately inflated by over 40%**
through collusion between Nepali officials and the Chinese contractor,
China CAMC Engineering. Investigations have uncovered **massive
procurement irregularities**, misuse of funds, and substandard work. In
late 2025, Nepal's anti-graft agency charged **55 individuals (including
former ministers and secretaries)** and the Chinese firm in connection
with this
fraud[\[1\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=New%20Delhi%3A%20Nepal%E2%80%99s%20anti,by%20roughly%20%2474%20million)[\[2\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=KATHMANDU%2C%20Dec%209%20%28Reuters%29%20,Nepal%2C%20officials%20said%20on%20Tuesday).
The case highlights serious governance failings in Nepal's public
procurement and the **lack of accountability** in projects under China's
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

*Pokhara International Airport in Pokhara, Nepal, as seen during its
construction phase (mid-2022). The airport was conceived decades ago and
finally inaugurated in January 2023, but soon became mired in a
corruption scandal.*

- **1971:** Initial concept for a new international airport in Pokhara
  was conceived, but the project stalled due to political turmoil and
  other
  delays[\[3\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=The%20Pokhara%20airport%20project%20has,site%20studies%20and%20cost%20estimates).
- **2008:** The plan was revived and formally proposed by Nepal's
  government[\[4\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=different,to%20finally%20file%20the%20case).
  Feasibility studies commenced, designating it a "national pride"
  project to prioritize development.
- **2011:** A **secret Memorandum of Understanding** came to light, in
  which then-Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun privately agreed to support
  China CAMC Engineering's bid for the airport contract. The MoU (signed
  without broader approval) was later scrapped amid public
  criticism[\[5\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=insurgency%2C%20public%20resistance%20and%20disputes,site%20studies%20and%20cost%20estimates).
- **2012:** An **international bidding** was held for the project. All
  bidders were pre-approved Chinese companies (per China Exim Bank's
  financing conditions). China CAMC Engineering unexpectedly offered the
  lowest bid of **\$305 million**, which was **far above Nepal's own
  estimate (\~\$170
  million)**[\[6\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=When%20bidding%20opened%20in%202012%2C,would%20be%20eligible%20for%20financing).
  This raised suspicions that the process was tilted in favor of Chinese
  firms and inflated costs.
- **2014:** After objections from regulators and observers, a Nepali
  government panel intervened. It recommended capping the cost at
  **\$215.96 million**, and this figure was adopted in a revised
  contract[\[7\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=its%20designated%20firms%20would%20be,eligible%20for%20financing).
  The contract was awarded to **China CAMC Engineering** under a
  government-to-government framework, bypassing open tender in the name
  of national
  interest[\[8\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20project%20was%20awarded,bypass%20transparency%20and%20tender%20requirements).
  Notably, the **contract was signed before a Detailed Project Report
  (DPR) was prepared**, an inversion of standard
  procedure[\[9\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=What%20procurement%20and%20contract%20violations,bids%20based%20on%20transparent%20parameters).
- **2016:** Nepal and China's Exim Bank signed a loan agreement to
  finance the project as a **turnkey** endeavor worth \$216
  million[\[10\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=The%20Chinese%20contractor%20China%20CAMC,project%20worth%20USD%20216%20million).
  The loan terms were **25% interest-free and 75% at 2% annual interest
  over 20 years**, and mandated the use of Chinese contractors and
  materials[\[11\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=Construction%20formally%20began%20in%202017%2C,those%20revenues%20have%20not%20happened)[\[12\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=The%20contract%E2%80%99s%20financial%20model%20was,accept%20CAMC%E2%80%99s%20specifications%20without%20negotiation).
  This tied the project closely to Chinese BRI financing conditions.
- **2017:** Formal **construction broke ground** under CAMC's execution.
  Over the next years, construction progressed but with frequent
  extensions and little transparency. Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority
  (CAAN) largely relied on CAMC's self-reported progress and cost
  estimates[\[13\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=CAMC%20was%20awarded%20the%20construction,how%20it%20would%20be%20executed)[\[14\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Nepal%E2%80%99s%20failure%20to%20enforce%20contractual,due%20to%20unresolved%20calibration%20issues).
- **2022:** Construction was **completed in late 2022**, behind schedule
  and over budget. The final cost recorded was about **NPR 22 billion**
  (up from an initial estimate of NPR 12--14
  billion)[\[15\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=partially%20been%20created,reflected%20in%20others%20as%20well)[\[16\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=Initially%20estimated%20to%20cost%20NRs,findings%20to%20lawmakers%20for%20review).
  Crucially, auditors later found that several contracted works were
  *not* fully carried out despite payments (e.g. fuel storage facility,
  heating
  systems)[\[17\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%C2%A0New%20York%20Times%C2%A0investigation%C2%A0in,not%20been%20constructed%20at%20all).
- **Jan 1, 2023:** The airport was **inaugurated** with great fanfare by
  then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal
  (Prachanda)[\[18\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=KATHMANDU%3A%20Pokhara%20International%20Airport%2C%20inaugurated,made%20public%20in%20April%202025)[\[4\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=different,to%20finally%20file%20the%20case).
  It was touted as a milestone to boost tourism in western Nepal and
  relieve congestion at Kathmandu's airport. However, **no regular
  international flights** commenced. (By early 2025, only an occasional
  charter to Lhasa was
  operating[\[19\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=promoted%20by%20Beijing%20as%20a,venture%2C%20connects%20Pokhara%20to%20Lhasa).)
- **Mid 2023:** Nepal attempted to operationalize the airport. In June
  2023, the first international charter flight (Sichuan Airlines) landed
  with Chinese delegates for a sporting
  event[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara_International_Airport#:~:text=In%20June%202023%2C%20the%20airport,boat%20race.%5B%2028).
  Nevertheless, airlines remained hesitant due to technical issues
  (radar calibration, short runway) and lack of air routes from
  India[\[21\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=One%20major%20issue%20is%20the,airport%E2%80%99s%20safety%20and%20communication%20protocols)[\[22\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20the%20airport%E2%80%99s%20runway%20length,CAAN%20to%20attract%20foreign%20airlines).
  Nepal requested new air corridors from India, but approvals were
  pending, limiting the airport's
  viability[\[23\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Another%20obstacle%20is%20the%20absence,adding%20Pokhara%20to%20their%20schedules).
- **Oct 2023:** An investigative report by *The New York Times* exposed
  serious issues in the airport's construction. It found the project
  **costs were deliberately inflated** and corners cut in design and
  safety
  features[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara_International_Airport#:~:text=In%20October%202023%2C%20the%20airport%27s,12).
  A consultant noted Nepal had likely been charged **"at least double"**
  the fair market cost due to lack of
  oversight[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara_International_Airport#:~:text=costs%20were%20deliberately%20inflated%2C%20and,12).
  For example, local rainfall and soil conditions were ignored (raising
  flood risks), and key works were left
  incomplete[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara_International_Airport#:~:text=In%20October%202023%2C%20the%20airport%27s,12).
  The NYT also reported that CAMC evaded about **\$16 million in taxes**
  that it was contractually obliged to
  pay[\[17\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%C2%A0New%20York%20Times%C2%A0investigation%C2%A0in,not%20been%20constructed%20at%20all).
  These revelations heightened public scrutiny.
- **Nov 2023:** Nepal's **Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of
  Authority (CIAA)** -- the anti-graft agency -- officially opened an
  investigation into the Pokhara Airport
  project[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara_International_Airport#:~:text=2023).
  The project's designation as a "national pride" project had previously
  shielded it from scrutiny, but mounting evidence spurred action.
- **2024:** Throughout 2024, investigators gathered documents and
  witness statements. A Public Accounts Committee **subcommittee in
  Parliament** conducted its own inquiry, while CIAA seized project
  files for forensic
  audit[\[27\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=Accounts%20Committee%20of%20the%20House,to%20finally%20file%20the%20case)[\[28\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=conduct%20a%20deeper%20probe,to%20finally%20file%20the%20case).
  (It later emerged that the CIAA had taken possession of key documents
  as early as 2022, but progress was
  slow[\[29\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=Accounts%20Committee%20of%20the%20House,to%20finally%20file%20the%20case).)
  Meanwhile, the airport saw minimal usage; Nepali airlines mostly stuck
  to the old Pokhara domestic airport due to logistical
  convenience[\[30\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20the%20debt%20burden%20from,airport%20due%20to%20logistical%20convenience).
- **April 2025:** A report by the **House Public Accounts Committee
  (PAC)** subcommittee was tabled in Parliament, revealing **"massive
  corruption"** in the
  project[\[31\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=become%20mired%20in%20controversy,highlights%20governance%20failures%20in%20Nepal%E2%80%99s)[\[32\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=A%20Nepalese%20parliamentary%20investigation%20has,PAC%29%20has%20concluded).
  The committee, led by MP Rajendra Lingden, concluded that
  **irregularities worth \~NPR 14 billion** (≈ \$106 million) had
  occurred[\[33\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=A%20Nepalese%20parliamentary%20investigation%20has,PAC%29%20has%20concluded)[\[34\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=,corruption%20scandal%20in%20Nepali%20history).
  It detailed extensive procurement fraud, cost inflation, and collusion
  (summarized in later sections). The PAC urged swift action,
  recommending suspension of officials like CAAN's Director General and
  further investigation of all
  involved[\[35\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20report%20holds%20the%20Civil,officials%20involved%20in%20the%20project).
- **Sept 2025:** Nepal was rocked by large **youth-led anti-corruption
  protests**, unrelated to just the airport but fueled by public anger
  over systemic graft. These "Gen-Z" demonstrations turned violent and
  resulted in dozens of
  deaths[\[36\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20rampant%20in%20Nepal%2C,situated%20between%20China%20and%20India)[\[37\]](https://apnews.com/article/nepal-china-corruption-airport-c112cb659a00efd348ea270f97f1e861#:~:text=Court%20cases%20in%20Nepal%20can,not%20years%20to%20be%20resolved).
  The unrest forced Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign. In an
  unprecedented move, former Chief Justice **Sushila Karki** was
  appointed interim Prime Minister to oversee reforms and new
  elections[\[36\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20rampant%20in%20Nepal%2C,situated%20between%20China%20and%20India).
  This political earthquake underscored the public's demand for
  accountability and created an environment empowering agencies like the
  CIAA to act decisively.
- **Dec 2025:** After nearly two years of investigation, the CIAA filed
  a comprehensive **charge-sheet at the Special Court** in Kathmandu,
  marking it as Nepal's *largest corruption case in history*. **55
  defendants** were charged -- including a Chinese state firm and dozens
  of high-ranking Nepali officials -- for **illegally inflating the
  Pokhara Airport's cost by over \$74
  million**[\[2\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=KATHMANDU%2C%20Dec%209%20%28Reuters%29%20,Nepal%2C%20officials%20said%20on%20Tuesday)[\[1\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=New%20Delhi%3A%20Nepal%E2%80%99s%20anti,by%20roughly%20%2474%20million).
  The Special Court began summoning the accused, though trials in Nepal
  can take years to
  conclude[\[38\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=Yagya%20Raj%20Regmi%2C%20assistant%20spokesperson,Ltd%20that%20constructed%20the%20project)[\[39\]](https://apnews.com/article/nepal-china-corruption-airport-c112cb659a00efd348ea270f97f1e861#:~:text=4%20MIN%20READ).

## Procurement Irregularities and Bidding Process

The **procurement process for the airport was highly irregular and
violated Nepal's Public Procurement
Act**[\[9\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=What%20procurement%20and%20contract%20violations,bids%20based%20on%20transparent%20parameters)[\[8\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20project%20was%20awarded,bypass%20transparency%20and%20tender%20requirements).
Several key deviations and red flags include:

- **No Competitive Bidding:** Instead of a normal open tender, the
  project was awarded via a **government-to-government deal** with
  China. Nepal's cabinet designated the airport a "national pride
  project" under special conditions, which was later criticized as a
  pretext to bypass transparency and
  competition[\[8\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20project%20was%20awarded,bypass%20transparency%20and%20tender%20requirements).
  In effect, only Chinese contractors vetted by the Chinese lender were
  allowed to bid in 2012, undermining fair
  competition[\[6\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=When%20bidding%20opened%20in%202012%2C,would%20be%20eligible%20for%20financing).

- **Contract Before DPR:** In an extreme breach of procedure, the
  construction **contract was signed *before* a Detailed Project
  Report** was prepared or
  approved[\[9\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=What%20procurement%20and%20contract%20violations,bids%20based%20on%20transparent%20parameters).
  China CAMC Engineering was allowed to **submit the DPR after winning
  the contract**, essentially letting the contractor define its own
  scope of work, budget, and timeline without independent
  oversight[\[40\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=best%20practices%20during%20the%20construction,bids%20based%20on%20transparent%20parameters)[\[13\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=CAMC%20was%20awarded%20the%20construction,how%20it%20would%20be%20executed).
  This reversed the normal order (feasibility study → design → tender)
  and enabled cost manipulation.

- **Self-Determined Costs:** With no third-party cost verification,
  CAMC's submitted plan became the basis for the project. **CAMC
  effectively dictated the project cost** -- initially proposing \$305M,
  later settling at \$216M after controversy -- and **no independent
  expert or consultant was empowered to vet these
  figures**[\[6\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=When%20bidding%20opened%20in%202012%2C,would%20be%20eligible%20for%20financing)[\[7\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=its%20designated%20firms%20would%20be,eligible%20for%20financing).
  In fact, oversight budgets were slashed: a consulting budget of \$2.8
  million was cut to just \$10,000, leaving Nepal with almost no
  capacity to supervise the
  contractor[\[41\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=official%20bidding%20process%2C%20with%20Chinese,given%20exclusive%20rights%20to%20bid)[\[42\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=CAMC%27s%20initial%20USD%20305%20million,million%20to%20just%20USD%2010%2C000).

- **Tied Loan Conditions:** The Chinese EXIM Bank loan came with
  conditions that **all major works, equipment, and services be procured
  from Chinese
  sources**[\[12\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=The%20contract%E2%80%99s%20financial%20model%20was,accept%20CAMC%E2%80%99s%20specifications%20without%20negotiation).
  Nepal had little say in sourcing. Many equipment items (e.g. runway
  lights, navigation systems) were **significantly overpriced -- up to
  300% above market value** -- but Nepal was obligated to accept CAMC's
  specifications and
  vendors[\[12\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=The%20contract%E2%80%99s%20financial%20model%20was,accept%20CAMC%E2%80%99s%20specifications%20without%20negotiation)[\[43\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=was%20obligated%20to%20accept%20CAMC%E2%80%99s,specifications%20without%20negotiation).
  This arrangement inflated costs and crowded out any local or alternate
  suppliers.

- **Turnkey Contract Favoring Contractor:** The project was executed as
  a *turnkey* contract, meaning CAMC took full control of design and
  construction, handing over a completed facility to Nepal. However,
  **Nepal's agencies failed to enforce contractual safeguards**.
  Deadlines were extended without penalties, and quality control was
  lax[\[44\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Nepal%E2%80%99s%20failure%20to%20enforce%20contractual,due%20to%20unresolved%20calibration%20issues).
  Notably, the Chinese firm even acquired the Nepali consultant (IPPR
  International Engineering) that was supposed to supervise quality,
  creating a blatant conflict of
  interest[\[45\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=including%20consulting%20budgets%2C%20were%20drastically,million%20to%20just%20USD%2010%2C000).

In summary, the **procurement phase was marked by opacity and
collusion**. Standard checks and balances were disregarded, allowing the
contractor to **"write the rules" and then break them with
impunity**[\[46\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=management%20team%20for%20rubber,CAMC%E2%80%99s%20dominance%20in%20project%20execution).
This set the stage for the large-scale corruption that followed.

## Cost Inflation and Corruption Details

Once the contract was underway, evidence shows that **project costs were
deliberately inflated and public funds misused** through various
fraudulent means. Key examples of corruption and misconduct include:

- **Inflated Contract Value:** Investigators found that Nepali officials
  and CAMC **padded the project cost to about \$244 million from an
  initial \$170 million estimate** -- roughly a **44%
  inflation**[\[47\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=ACCUSED%20INFLATED%20CONSTRUCTION%20COSTS%20BY,OVER%2040).
  By February 2024, Nepal had paid CAMC approximately \$224.8 million,
  of which **\$74.3 million** is considered *losses from overvaluation
  and fraudulent
  billing*[\[48\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=The%20CIAA%20charged%20that%20CAMC,04%20million).
  The CIAA charge-sheet accuses the Nepali-Chinese team of using *fake
  invoices, overbilling, and substandard materials* to jack up
  expenses[\[1\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=New%20Delhi%3A%20Nepal%E2%80%99s%20anti,by%20roughly%20%2474%20million)[\[49\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=The%20agency%20alleges%20that%20Nepalese,the%20usage%20of%20substandard%20materials).

- **Ghost Services and Works Not Done:** The parliamentary probe
  uncovered that CAMC was paid for several items never properly
  executed. For example, **\$5.5 million was paid for soil transport
  that never
  occurred**[\[50\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20probe%20found%20major%20breaches%2C,contractually%20the%20Chinese%20contractor%E2%80%99s%20responsibility).
  Similarly, **\$10.65 million was paid for airport drainage
  construction and \$4.44 million for soil compaction**, but these works
  were either not done or done below
  standard[\[51\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=spent%20millions%20to%20level%20a,contractually%20the%20Chinese%20contractor%E2%80%99s%20responsibility).
  A fuel storage facility and a heating/ventilation system were listed
  as "completed" and paid for, yet **had not been built at all** as of
  2023[\[17\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%C2%A0New%20York%20Times%C2%A0investigation%C2%A0in,not%20been%20constructed%20at%20all).

- **Runway and Design Deviations:** The contract stipulated the runway's
  elevation to be 2,674--2,677 feet above sea level, but the completed
  runway was at **2,636 feet**, significantly **lower than
  agreed**[\[50\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20probe%20found%20major%20breaches%2C,contractually%20the%20Chinese%20contractor%E2%80%99s%20responsibility).
  This deviation could have safety implications (flood risk) and
  suggests negligent execution. Additionally, CAMC failed to complete
  critical earthworks -- a New York Times investigation noted they
  **left excavation/refilling incomplete** on the runway, potentially
  compromising its
  integrity[\[17\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%C2%A0New%20York%20Times%C2%A0investigation%C2%A0in,not%20been%20constructed%20at%20all).

- **Overpriced Equipment:** Major systems were procured at grossly
  inflated prices. The **air traffic control radar, navigational aids,
  and lighting systems** were purchased at **2--3 times higher cost than
  global
  averages**[\[52\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=The%20contractor%20also%20insisted%20that,time%20of%20the%20PAC%20investigation)[\[53\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=norms,time%20of%20the%20PAC%20investigation).
  Despite paying premium prices (using loan money), some of these
  systems were **non-functional or substandard** upon installation. For
  instance, the radar system could not be calibrated and sat unused for
  months after
  inauguration[\[54\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=scrutiny,due%20to%20unresolved%20calibration%20issues)[\[55\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=One%20major%20issue%20is%20the,airport%E2%80%99s%20safety%20and%20communication%20protocols).
  Such overpricing strongly indicates kickbacks or collusion in
  procurement.

- **Tax Evasion and Exemptions:** Although the contract clearly stated
  the contractor must pay applicable taxes and duties, **CAMC was
  granted tax exemptions worth NPR 2.2 billion** (≈ \$16--18 million)
  during
  construction[\[56\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=for%20soil%20compaction%2C%20both%20without,proper%20execution)[\[57\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20subpanel%20also%20found%20that,be%20paid%20by%20the%20contractor).
  Essentially, the Nepali authorities waived taxes that the public
  treasury should have received, benefiting the contractor. Moreover,
  CAMC allegedly *evaded \$16 million in taxes* it was obligated to
  pay[\[17\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%C2%A0New%20York%20Times%C2%A0investigation%C2%A0in,not%20been%20constructed%20at%20all),
  suggesting complicity of officials in overlooking tax dues.

- **Collusion via "Expert" Committees:** A notable facet of the scam was
  the role of a so-called **independent review committee**. Three
  professors from Tribhuvan University's engineering institute were
  commissioned to review project costs -- they produced a **"technically
  baseless" report recommending raising the cost to \$230
  million**[\[58\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=justification%20and%20violated%20Nepal%E2%80%99s%20Public,Procurement%20Act).
  CIAA investigators found the committee was instructed to rubber-stamp
  the inflated cost quickly *"without access to necessary documents"*,
  essentially providing a fig-leaf of
  justification[\[59\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=Even%20academicians%20are%20involved,without%20access%20to%20necessary%20documents).
  CAMC and officials then used this report to approve the bloated
  contract of \$244
  million[\[48\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=The%20CIAA%20charged%20that%20CAMC,04%20million).
  This indicates academic fraud and bribery extending into the oversight
  mechanisms.

These corrupt practices caused a loss estimated at **NPR 8--14 billion**
to the Nepali
state[\[60\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=already%20been%20filed%20against%20Adhikari,have%20been%20significantly%20more%20advanced)[\[32\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=A%20Nepalese%20parliamentary%20investigation%20has,PAC%29%20has%20concluded).
They also resulted in a technically flawed airport: **many systems
weren't up to standard or operational**, and the facility could not
attract airlines, turning it into a white
elephant[\[61\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=Despite%20its%20inauguration%20earlier%20this,as%20a%20%27White%20Elephant%27%20project)[\[55\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=One%20major%20issue%20is%20the,airport%E2%80%99s%20safety%20and%20communication%20protocols).
The scandal thus encompasses both **financial corruption and gross
mismanagement**, endangering the project's viability.

## Key Actors Involved

Multiple actors -- across government, regulatory agencies, and the
contractor -- were involved in the Pokhara Airport fraud. The web of
responsibility spans from high-level politicians to technical officials
and corporate executives:

- **Chinese Contractor (CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd.):** As the project's
  main contractor, China CAMC (a subsidiary of state-owned Sinomach) is
  at the center of the scandal. **CAMC's project leadership** allegedly
  dictated terms from the start, exploited the lack of oversight, and
  engaged in
  overbilling[\[13\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=CAMC%20was%20awarded%20the%20construction,how%20it%20would%20be%20executed)[\[46\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=management%20team%20for%20rubber,CAMC%E2%80%99s%20dominance%20in%20project%20execution).
  The CIAA's charges name **CAMC itself as a defendant**, alongside two
  top executives: **Chairman Wang Bo** and **Regional General Manager
  Liu
  Shengcheng**[\[62\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=bureaucrats%2C%20including%20secretaries%2C%20joint%20secretaries%2C,a%20former%20Supreme%20Court%20registrar).
  The firm's practices -- such as preparing its own DPR, sourcing only
  from Chinese suppliers at high prices, and acquiring the supervision
  consultant -- point to willful misconduct and collusion in
  graft[\[52\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=The%20contractor%20also%20insisted%20that,time%20of%20the%20PAC%20investigation)[\[45\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=including%20consulting%20budgets%2C%20were%20drastically,million%20to%20just%20USD%2010%2C000).

- **Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN):** CAAN was the
  implementing agency overseeing the airport. The **Director Generals of
  CAAN during the project period are heavily implicated**. Notably,
  **Pradeep Adhikari**, the CAAN DG (suspended in 2023 due to another
  case), is charged with abusing authority and colluding with
  CAMC[\[63\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=the%20%E2%80%9Cbig%20fish%E2%80%9D%20is%20underway,state%20is%20believed%20to%20have)[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).
  Two former CAAN DGs -- **Sanjeev Gautam** and **Rajan Pokharel** --
  who were in office during earlier phases, are also under investigation
  for failing to enforce standards and possibly facilitating
  irregularities[\[35\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20report%20holds%20the%20Civil,officials%20involved%20in%20the%20project).
  Several **CAAN board members and project officials** have been named
  as well, including **Madan Kharel, Mukti Narayan Paudel, Jyoti
  Adhikari, Manoj Karki,** and **Phurwa Chhiring
  Sherpa**[\[65\]\[66\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=Among%20those%20charged%20are%20former,Sherpa%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).
  These individuals were responsible for project decisions, contract
  management, and payments.

- **Government Ministers:** **Five former ministers** of Nepal are
  charged for their role in approving and enabling the inflated
  contract[\[67\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=Among%20those%20charged%20are%20former,a%20former%20Supreme%20Court%20registrar)[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).
  They span tourism, aviation, and finance portfolios over the years:

- **Ram Sharan Mahat** -- Former Finance Minister (and influential
  leader in Nepali Congress). He was involved in the 2014--2016 phase
  when the loan agreement was signed and is accused of endorsing the
  high-cost
  contract[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).

- **Post Bahadur Bogati** -- Former Tourism Minister (now deceased) who
  had pushed the airport project; charged posthumously for decisions
  under his
  tenure[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).

- **Bhim Prasad Acharya** -- Former Minister (and later a provincial
  Chief Minister); allegedly involved in pushing through cost
  escalations[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).

- **Deepak Chandra Amatya** -- Former Minister (Civil Aviation or
  Tourism) implicated in contract
  irregularities[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).

- **Ram Kumar Shrestha** -- Former Minister, also charged for
  involvement in the
  corruption[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).
  These politicians are accused of abusing their authority by
  green-lighting contracts and payments **without due diligence**, and
  in some cases possibly receiving benefits from the deal.

- **Senior Bureaucrats (Secretaries):** At least **10 former
  secretaries** (top civil service officials) are among the
  accused[\[68\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=General%20of%20the%20Civil%20Aviation,irregularities%2C%20Nepal%E2%80%99s%20development%20trajectory%20would)[\[69\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=International%20Airport.%20The%20charge%20sheet,CAAN).
  The charge-sheet specifically names **Sushil Ghimire, Madhukar
  Marasini, Suman Prasad Sharma, Surya Prasad Acharya, Suresh Man
  Shrestha, Bhesh Raj Sharma**, among
  others[\[65\]\[66\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=Among%20those%20charged%20are%20former,Sherpa%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).
  These officials served in ministries like Tourism, Finance, or
  National Planning and were part of project steering committees or loan
  negotiations. They are alleged to have **approved inflated estimates,
  granted unwarranted tax breaks, or ignored procurement law** in the
  interest of expediency (or under political pressure).

- **Consultants/Experts:** Three Nepali engineering professors (Rabindra
  Nath Shrestha, Santosh Kumar Shrestha, and Surya Gyawali) who sat on
  the 2017 cost review committee have been implicated for signing off on
  unjustified cost
  increases[\[58\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=justification%20and%20violated%20Nepal%E2%80%99s%20Public,Procurement%20Act).
  By producing a misleading report to raise the budget, they effectively
  aided the collusion. Additionally, the Chinese-appointed consultant
  **IPPR International Engineering** (ostensibly hired for quality
  control) acted in CAMC's interest -- notably, CAMC acquired IPPR
  midway, nullifying independent
  oversight[\[45\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=including%20consulting%20budgets%2C%20were%20drastically,million%20to%20just%20USD%2010%2C000).
  Allegations emerged that **IPPR falsified staff credentials** and did
  little to check CAMC's
  work[\[45\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=including%20consulting%20budgets%2C%20were%20drastically,million%20to%20just%20USD%2010%2C000).

- **Others:** Interestingly, even a **former Supreme Court registrar**
  is listed among the
  accused[\[70\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=Among%20those%20charged%20are%20former,a%20former%20Supreme%20Court%20registrar),
  possibly due to a prior role in government or as a legal advisor in
  the contract process. This underlines the breadth of the network
  involved. Furthermore, the **Ministry of Finance** as an institution
  is criticized for not providing all documents requested by
  investigators, hinting at institutional reluctance to expose the full
  extent of
  irregularities[\[34\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=,corruption%20scandal%20in%20Nepali%20history).

In sum, the **actors in this scandal form a "nexus" of corrupt
collaboration**[\[71\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=democracy%20has%20earned%20a%20poor,airport%20in%20Pokhara%20was%20first)
-- involving bureaucrats, contractors, and politicians. This reflects a
known pattern in Nepal (and other countries) where big infrastructure
projects become cash cows for elites through kickbacks and collusion.
The Pokhara Airport case starkly exposed how each of these actors failed
the public interest.

## Investigations and Findings

The corruption came to light through layered investigative efforts: -
**Parliamentary Probe (PAC Subcommittee):** Responding to public outcry,
the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament formed a subcommittee to
audit the project. Their extensive inquiry (completed by April 2025)
confirmed **11 categories of
irregularities**[\[72\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=Initially%20estimated%20to%20cost%20NRs,findings%20to%20lawmakers%20for%20review).
The **PAC report** quantified the loss at about **NPR 14 billion** and
labeled Pokhara Airport **"one of the largest corruption scandal in
Nepali
history"**[\[34\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=,corruption%20scandal%20in%20Nepali%20history).
Key findings from the PAC (many detailed earlier) included: payments for
unexecuted works, elevation and design breaches, misuse of tax waivers,
and systematic cost inflation. The committee unequivocally held **CAAN
leadership accountable** for failing to safeguard public
funds[\[35\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20report%20holds%20the%20Civil,officials%20involved%20in%20the%20project).
It recommended immediate suspension of CAAN's DG (Pradeep Adhikari) and
investigations into former CAAN heads and ministry
officials[\[35\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20report%20holds%20the%20Civil,officials%20involved%20in%20the%20project).
The PAC also flagged the procedural violation of contract-before-DPR and
lack of feasibility studies as root
causes[\[73\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=the%20Pokhara%20International%20Airport%20project,after%20the%20construction%20contract%20was)[\[74\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=It%20reveals%20that%20CAAN%20colluded,have%20sparked%20national%20debate%20on).
These findings were disseminated to all lawmakers, intensifying pressure
on anti-graft bodies to
act[\[16\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=Initially%20estimated%20to%20cost%20NRs,findings%20to%20lawmakers%20for%20review).

- **CIAA Investigation:** The **Commission for Investigation of Abuse of
  Authority**, Nepal's constitutional anti-corruption watchdog, took up
  the case following the PAC report and earlier suspicions. The CIAA had
  actually begun collecting evidence earlier -- it **seized documents in
  2023** on PAC's
  directive[\[29\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=Accounts%20Committee%20of%20the%20House,to%20finally%20file%20the%20case)
  -- but moved slowly until the political shake-up in late 2025 cleared
  the path for assertive
  action[\[75\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=The%20government%20formed%20under%20Prime,been%20grounds%20for%20suspicion%20about)[\[36\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20rampant%20in%20Nepal%2C,situated%20between%20China%20and%20India).
  The CIAA deployed technical experts to review contracts, audit
  payments, and trace decision-making. It coordinated with the Auditor
  General and sought international help to verify prices. By late 2025,
  the CIAA concluded that a *criminal conspiracy to defraud the state*
  had taken place. On **December 7, 2025**, the CIAA filed its
  charge-sheet at the Special Court, calling it **"one of the largest
  corruption cases in Nepal's aviation
  history"**[\[76\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=The%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation,CAAN).
  The filing accuses the 55 individuals (and CAMC) of **financially
  harming the state by NRs 8.36 billion** (≈ \$74 million) through
  collusive cost
  escalation[\[1\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=New%20Delhi%3A%20Nepal%E2%80%99s%20anti,by%20roughly%20%2474%20million)[\[77\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=officials%20said%20on%20Tuesday).
  It seeks recovery of this amount **from each defendant** as
  fines[\[78\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=Show%20Full%20Article)[\[79\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=Sign%20up%20here)
  -- a draconian penalty reflecting the magnitude of the offense.

- **Key Evidence:** The CIAA's case is built on evidence such as
  internal correspondence, contract amendments, bank payment records,
  and expert analyses. For example, it documented the timeline of cost
  revisions, showing how **an estimate of \$170M was inflated to
  contract value \$244M without technical
  basis**[\[47\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=ACCUSED%20INFLATED%20CONSTRUCTION%20COSTS%20BY,OVER%2040).
  Payment ledgers revealed that **by 2024 nearly \$225M had been paid
  out**, well above the original loan sum (implying additional funds or
  overdrawn
  loan)[\[48\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=The%20CIAA%20charged%20that%20CAMC,04%20million).
  Investigators also recorded statements from committee members who
  admitted they were pressured to justify higher costs quickly,
  corroborating the collusion
  narrative[\[59\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=Even%20academicians%20are%20involved,without%20access%20to%20necessary%20documents).
  Physical inspections at the site (and the NYT's on-ground reporting)
  provided proof of works left incomplete or equipment lying idle,
  contradicting the paid
  invoices[\[17\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%C2%A0New%20York%20Times%C2%A0investigation%C2%A0in,not%20been%20constructed%20at%20all)[\[54\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=scrutiny,due%20to%20unresolved%20calibration%20issues).

- **Legal Proceedings:** After the CIAA's filing, the Special Court in
  Kathmandu began processing the case. As of December 2025, the court
  **issued notices to all accused** to appear and provide written
  statements[\[80\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=None%20of%20the%20accused%20could,be%20reached%20for%20comment).
  Two high-profile accused (Pradeep Adhikari and Murari Bhandari of
  CAAN) were already in judicial custody for a separate case (a scandal
  involving a helipad construction) and would be tried in the airport
  case as
  well[\[64\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/ciaa-moves-to-file-charges-against-55-individuals-including-former-ministers-and-secretaries-in-pokhara-international-airport-corruption-case#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CIAA%2C%20former,case%2C%20have%20also%20been%20named).
  The Special Court's assistant spokesperson indicated that **hearings
  would commence after defendants respond**, but given Nepal's legal
  pace, a final verdict could take **months or
  years**[\[81\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Special%20Court%20will%20now,give%20judgement%2C%E2%80%9D%20Regmi%20told%20Reuters)[\[39\]](https://apnews.com/article/nepal-china-corruption-airport-c112cb659a00efd348ea270f97f1e861#:~:text=4%20MIN%20READ).
  The CIAA has reportedly prepared three separate charge-sheets related
  to Pokhara Airport, possibly to tackle different aspects or periods of
  the
  project[\[82\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=final%20sentencing%2C%20however%2C%20depends%20on,a%20court%20verdict).

- **Accountability Measures:** In the interim, some administrative
  actions have been taken. The government suspended officials named in
  the PAC report (such as CAAN's
  DG)[\[35\]](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/nepal-corruption-scandal-pokhara-international-airport-c966376d#:~:text=The%20report%20holds%20the%20Civil,officials%20involved%20in%20the%20project).
  By the time of the CIAA charge, **many accused had left office** --
  some retired, some promoted elsewhere. The fallout nonetheless has
  tarnished reputations: for instance, **Madhukar Marasini**, one
  accused ex-secretary, was serving as Nepal's Finance Secretary in 2025
  and faced removal after charges were filed. Politically, the scandal
  added momentum to anti-corruption rhetoric in the run-up to the March
  2026 general elections, with parties vowing stricter oversight of BRI
  projects.

## Current Status and Implications

As of end-2025, the Pokhara International Airport stands as a
**cautionary tale** of infrastructure ambition gone awry:

- **Operational Status:** The airport is **open but vastly
  underutilized**. Despite being "international," it has struggled to
  attract scheduled foreign
  flights[\[19\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=promoted%20by%20Beijing%20as%20a,venture%2C%20connects%20Pokhara%20to%20Lhasa).
  Nearly **two years after inauguration, no major airline has regular
  service** there. One weekly flight by a Nepal-China joint venture
  airline to Lhasa was the only international link, alongside a few
  charters[\[19\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=promoted%20by%20Beijing%20as%20a,venture%2C%20connects%20Pokhara%20to%20Lhasa).
  Domestic carriers mostly prefer the older Pokhara airport downtown.
  The new airport's state-of-art radar and navigation equipment largely
  sit idle, some still not fully
  functional[\[55\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=One%20major%20issue%20is%20the,airport%E2%80%99s%20safety%20and%20communication%20protocols).
  The runway's length (2,500 m) allows narrow-body jets but is marginal
  for heavier long-hauls, limiting its
  appeal[\[83\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=schedules).
  In essence, Pokhara got a shiny new airport but **little economic
  return so far, while the loan meter ticks**.

- **Debt Burden:** Nepal now owes China's Exim Bank about **\$216
  million in loan principal**, plus interest, for this
  project[\[84\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=international%20aspirations,and%20construction%20phases%20of%20the)[\[11\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=Construction%20formally%20began%20in%202017%2C,those%20revenues%20have%20not%20happened).
  With meager revenue from the airport, repaying this debt is a
  challenge. By 2025, Nepali officials openly feared the airport could
  become a **"debt
  trap"**[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara_International_Airport#:~:text=double%20the%20market%20rate.,).
  The government even **appealed to China to convert the loan into a
  grant**[\[86\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=facility%20had%20not%20been%20constructed,at%20all).
  In August 2025, Prime Minister Oli formally requested debt relief, and
  reportedly raised the issue with President Xi Jinping in
  November[\[86\]](https://theprint.in/world/pokhara-airport-project-nepals-anti-graft-body-charges-chinese-firm-in-largest-corruption-case/2800788/#:~:text=facility%20had%20not%20been%20constructed,at%20all).
  However, no agreement was reached, and Nepal remains liable for the
  full amount. The case thus exemplifies the financial risks of
  Chinese-funded projects that **overrun costs and underperform**.

- **Legal Outlook:** The corruption case is poised to move forward under
  heightened public attention. Given its scale, the Special Court may
  choose to fast-track hearings. If convicted, the accused face not only
  jail terms under anti-graft laws but also the enormous fines (NPR 8.36
  billion each) sought by
  CIAA[\[79\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=Sign%20up%20here).
  Observers note, however, that **Nepal's judiciary is slow** and
  high-profile corruption cases often drag
  on[\[39\]](https://apnews.com/article/nepal-china-corruption-airport-c112cb659a00efd348ea270f97f1e861#:~:text=4%20MIN%20READ).
  Some defendants could potentially abscond or use political influence
  to delay proceedings. The interim government under Sushila Karki has
  signaled support for letting the CIAA and courts work
  independently[\[75\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=The%20government%20formed%20under%20Prime,been%20grounds%20for%20suspicion%20about).
  The ultimate test will be whether convictions are secured and assets
  recovered, or if the case falters over time.

- **Governance Reforms:** The scandal has ignited debate on reforming
  public procurement and oversight. There are calls to **strengthen the
  Public Procurement Act** to close loopholes that allowed
  "government-to-government" deals without
  competition[\[8\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20project%20was%20awarded,bypass%20transparency%20and%20tender%20requirements).
  Experts advocate for mandatory **independent DPR and cost reviews**
  before signing big contracts, especially with foreign
  loans[\[40\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=best%20practices%20during%20the%20construction,bids%20based%20on%20transparent%20parameters)[\[87\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/explainers/pokhara-international-airport-scandal-uncovering-foul-play-in-china-loaned-bri-project/#:~:text=It%20reveals%20that%20CAAN%20colluded,and%20accountability%20for%20officials%20involved).
  The case also underscores the need for transparency in BRI or
  bilaterally-funded projects -- Nepal's experience shows that **opaque
  deals can compromise national interest**. As a result, future projects
  may face tougher scrutiny; for instance, citizens now demand that
  large infrastructure contracts (be it airports, dams, or highways) be
  awarded through open bidding and have robust monitoring to prevent
  another Pokhara-type fiasco.

- **Public Sentiment:** Locally in Pokhara, initial excitement for the
  international airport has given way to disillusionment. The project
  was a product of locals' long fight to get an international
  gateway[\[88\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=projects%20are%20riddled%20with%20irregularities%2C,due%20to%20the%20triangular%20nexus).
  Now, seeing it mired in scandal, many lament that *"We demanded an
  airport, not an opportunity for someone to pocket
  money"*[\[89\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-doubled-accountability-delayed-83-58.html#:~:text=the%20reality,Bureaucratic).
  Nationally, the case became a symbol of how corruption undercuts
  development. The **2025 youth protests**, in which dozens lost their
  lives, underscore how high the stakes have become in the public's
  quest for
  accountability[\[36\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepal-charges-55-officials-chinese-firm-airport-graft-case-officials-say-2025-12-09/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20rampant%20in%20Nepal%2C,situated%20between%20China%20and%20India)[\[37\]](https://apnews.com/article/nepal-china-corruption-airport-c112cb659a00efd348ea270f97f1e861#:~:text=Court%20cases%20in%20Nepal%20can,not%20years%20to%20be%20resolved).
  This scandal, therefore, is not just about one airport -- it has fed
  into a larger movement pressing for good governance in Nepal.

**Conclusion:** The Pokhara International Airport fraud spans a timeline
from lofty vision to troubled reality. It reveals how **weak governance,
when exploited by vested interests, can turn a vital development project
into a conduit for corruption**. The ongoing legal proceedings will be a
landmark test for Nepal's commitment to accountability. Regardless of
the court outcome, the case has already prompted Nepal to re-examine how
it undertakes large projects, especially with foreign partners, to
ensure transparency and public interest are not sacrificed.
