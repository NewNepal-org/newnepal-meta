**MODULE B: EXECUTIVE DOSSIER**

### **1\. Synopsis of the Malfeasance**

The Pokhara Regional International Airport (PRIA) project, initially conceived as a transformative infrastructure asset to unlock the tourism potential of Western Nepal, has devolved into the most significant corruption scandal in the nation's aviation history.1 The project serves as a paradigmatic case study of the convergence between domestic political corruption, bureaucratic complicity, and the opacity often associated with state-directed foreign infrastructure lending. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has formally charged 55 individuals and the Chinese contractor, China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd., with embezzling approximately USD 74.34 million through a sophisticated scheme of bid-rigging, cost inflation, and the certification of fictitious engineering works.1

The investigation reveals that the fraud was not an opportunistic event but a structural feature of the project's inception. From the initial bypassing of competitive bidding norms to the manipulation of engineering oversight, the project was engineered to extract rents rather than deliver a functional asset. The involvement spans the highest echelons of the Nepali state—including five former ministers and ten secretaries—and the academic elite, implicating professors who provided "technically baseless" reports to justify inflated costs.3

Crucially, the corruption has resulted in a "White Elephant" asset. The airport, inaugurated in January 2023, remains commercially unviable due to severe technical flaws—specifically a runway built at an incorrect elevation and payload restrictions—and a geopolitical deadlock with India regarding airspace access.4 Consequently, Nepal is burdened with a USD 215.96 million loan obligation to the China Exim Bank for an airport that generates negligible revenue, raising acute concerns regarding sovereign debt sustainability.6

### **2\. Strategic Implications & Governance Failure**

The PRIA case underscores a systemic collapse of public accountability mechanisms in Nepal. The project operated under the guise of a Government-to-Government (G2G) deal, which was effectively used to bypass the rigorous scrutiny mandated by the Public Procurement Act. The "Engineering, Procurement, and Construction" (EPC) model, intended to transfer risk to the contractor, was inverted; the Nepali state assumed all financial risks while the contractor, CAMC, secured guaranteed profits through inflated line items and tax exemptions that violated the contract's terms.7

Furthermore, the case highlights the geopolitical risks inherent in Nepal's infrastructure choices. The unilateral branding of the airport as a Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project by Chinese diplomats has alienated India, leading to the denial of critical air entry routes.1 This demonstrates how corruption in infrastructure procurement is not merely a financial crime but a strategic liability that can compromise national sovereignty and diplomatic relations.

## ---

**MODULE C: FINANCIAL FORENSIC ANALYSIS**

The financial architecture of the PRIA corruption involved three distinct phases of value extraction: the initial inflation of the base cost, the falsification of execution bills during construction, and the illegal waiver of tax liabilities post-contract.

### **1\. The Cost Inflation Mechanism (The "Negotiation" Trap)**

The foundational fraud occurred during the tender evaluation and contract negotiation phase (2012-2014). The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) had established a baseline cost estimate of **USD 169.69 million** for the project, derived from master plans and feasibility studies.3

When bids were opened, China CAMC Engineering quoted **USD 305 million**, a figure approximately 80% higher than the government's estimate. Under normal procurement rules, such a deviation would necessitate a retender. However, the process was manipulated to retain CAMC. A "Three-Member Committee" comprising academic experts from Tribhuvan University was formed to review the costs. This committee, acting in alleged collusion with the defendants, provided a justification for a revised cost of **USD 215.96 million**.3

While optically presented as a "savings" of nearly USD 90 million from the bid price, this figure remained **USD 46.27 million (27.2%)** higher than the government's own validation. The CIAA alleges this difference represents the primary tranche of kickbacks and inflated profit margins embedded into the contract before work commenced.

**Table C.1: The Inflation Trajectory**

| Milestone | Value (USD) | Variance from Baseline | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Government Estimate (2011)** | $169,690,000 | \- | Based on JICA/ADB feasibility studies. |
| **CAMC Initial Bid (2012)** | $305,000,000 | \+79.7% | Artificially high anchor price. |
| **"Negotiated" Contract (2014)** | $215,960,000 | \+27.2% | The compromised figure used to sign the EPC contract. |
| **Final Claimed Cost (2023)** | \~$244,040,000 | \+43.8% | Includes unauthorized variations and VAT manipulations. |
| **Total Embezzlement** | **$74,340,000** | **43.8%** | Total recoverable amount sought by CIAA. |

### **2\. Line-Item Fraud: Billing for Fictitious Works**

The investigation by the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the CIAA revealed that the contractor billed for specific engineering tasks that were either never performed or performed to a standard far below the billed specifications.

#### **A. The Soil Transport & Filling Scam (USD 5.5 Million)**

The contract explicitly required the runway and apron to be elevated using high-quality riverbed material transported from a distance of at least 5 kilometers (specifically from the Kotre and Bijayapur rivers) to ensure proper soil density and drainage.11

* **The Reality:** Physical audits revealed that CAMC utilized "cut-and-fill" methods, excavating soil from higher elevations within the airport perimeter and spreading it on the runway.  
* **The Fraud:** Despite using on-site soil (which costs negligible amounts to move), CAMC billed the project **USD 5.5 million** for the external transportation of material.  
* **Technical Impact:** The use of on-site soil, which was not tested for appropriate density and compaction standards, has compromised the runway's foundation, leading to potential long-term subsidence risks.13

#### **B. The Drainage & Earthworks Void (USD 10.6 Million)**

A sum of **USD 10.648 million** was disbursed to CAMC for the construction of a comprehensive drainage system along the runway, taxiway, and apron. Forensic inspections by the sub-panel found that this work was largely non-existent or woefully incomplete, creating significant flood risks given Pokhara's high rainfall.14

#### **C. The HVAC Misappropriation (USD 742,000)**

The installation of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems was a core component of the terminal building contract. However, the project was charged an *additional* **USD 742,000** for HVAC works that should have been covered under the EPC contract. Furthermore, auditors found that the installed systems were of inferior quality and often non-functional.14

### **3\. Revenue Leakage: The Tax Exemption Scheme**

The EPC contract was structured as "tax-inclusive," meaning CAMC was responsible for paying all applicable Nepali taxes, including Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs duties. However, high-ranking officials at the Ministry of Finance and CAAN facilitated illegal exemptions.

* **The Mechanism:** Officials placed CAMC's import requirements on a "Master List" of tax-exempt goods, violating the specific conditions of the commercial contract.  
* **The Loss:** This maneuver cost the Nepali state approximately **NPR 2.22 billion (USD \~16.7 million)** in lost revenue, which effectively subsidized the contractor's profit margin at the taxpayer's expense.2

### **4\. Loan Structure & Debt Service**

The financial burden of this fraud is compounded by the loan terms with the China Exim Bank.

* **Total Loan:** USD 215.96 million.  
* **Tranche A (25%):** Interest-free.  
* **Tranche B (75%):** Concessional loan at **2% annual interest**.18  
* **Repayment Schedule:** 20-year maturity with a 7-year grace period.  
* **Current Status:** The grace period has expired. The annual debt service (interest \+ principal) is estimated at over **USD 3.2 million** in interest alone, plus principal repayment. With the airport generating minimal revenue, CAAN is forced to service this debt from its other revenue streams (primarily Tribhuvan International Airport), effectively decapitalizing Nepal's entire civil aviation sector.4

## ---

**MODULE D: OPERATIONAL & ENGINEERING AUDIT**

The corruption at PRIA was not merely financial; it resulted in severe engineering compromises that have rendered the airport technically deficient and commercially unviable.

### **1\. The Runway Elevation Deficit**

The most critical engineering failure concerns the runway elevation. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) and contract specifications required the runway to be built at an elevation of **2,674 to 2,677 feet** above sea level. This specific height was calculated to optimize the climb gradient required for aircraft to clear the surrounding terrain, particularly Rithepani Hill to the east.11

* **The Defect:** The constructed runway sits at **2,636 feet**, approximately 38-41 feet lower than the design requirement.12  
* **The Cause:** Lowering the runway elevation allowed the contractor to significantly reduce the volume of soil filling required, saving millions of dollars in material and transport costs—savings that were pocketed rather than passed on to the government.  
* **The Consequence:** A lower starting point for taking off aircraft means they are closer to the obstacles in their flight path. This necessitated the emergency (and costly) cutting of Rithepani Hill, involving the removal of 40 meters of terrain and deforestation of 600 trees, which cost the state an additional **NPR 320 million**.4

### **2\. Payload Penalties & Commercial Unviability**

Despite the hill cutting, the airport suffers from severe "Payload Penalties" due to the combination of its altitude, high temperatures, and remaining obstacle limitations caused by the flawed runway elevation.

* **Aerodynamic Reality:** For standard narrow-body jets like the Airbus A320-200 or Boeing 737-800, taking off from PRIA requires a significant reduction in weight to meet safety climb gradients.  
* **The Numbers:** Preliminary reports indicate a payload penalty of **5 to 10 tonnes** depending on temperature (higher temperature \= lower air density \= higher penalty).5  
* **Operational Impact:**  
  * An A320 with a capacity of \~158 passengers and cargo would have to leave **40-50% of seats empty** or fly with minimal fuel (limiting range) to take off safely.  
  * Flights to destinations longer than 1 hour 20 minutes (e.g., beyond Delhi or Dhaka) are commercially unviable because the aircraft cannot carry enough fuel and passengers simultaneously.5  
  * This effectively disqualifies PRIA from serving key labor markets (Malaysia, Gulf nations) or tourism hubs (Japan, Korea) with direct flights, rendering the "International" designation largely symbolic.21

### **3\. The "Self-Supervising" Consultant**

The failure of oversight is attributed to a massive conflict of interest in the consultancy arrangement. The project hired **IPPR International Engineering Corp.** to act as the independent engineering consultant responsible for verifying the quality of work and approving bills.

* **The Connection:** IPPR is a subsidiary of **Sinomach** (China National Machinery Industry Corporation). The contractor, **CAMC**, is *also* a subsidiary of Sinomach. In 2019, CAMC formally acquired IPPR, making them direct sister companies.11  
* **The Effect:** The "independent" supervisor was legally and financially tied to the contractor it was supposed to police. Personnel interviews suggest IPPR engineers were instructed by Beijing headquarters not to scrutinize CAMC's work, allowing the certification of phantom soil works and substandard drainage without objection.13

### **4\. Infrastructure Deficiencies**

* **Fuel Storage:** The airport opened without a functioning fuel depot, forcing airlines to rely on tanker trucks, further complicating logistics and turn-around times.22  
* **Material Quality:** The Auditor General's report noted the use of inferior construction materials in the terminal building, contradicting the "Grade A" specifications promised in the high-cost contract.11

**MODULE E: NETWORK ANALYSIS (THE ACTORS)**

The CIAA charge sheet identifies a "grand coalition" of 55 individuals, revealing a nexus that spanned multiple political administrations, the permanent bureaucracy, and the technical intelligentsia.

### **1\. The Political Enablers (Ministers)**

Five former ministers are named, indicating that the corruption was not limited to a single party but was a consensus activity across the political spectrum.

| Defendant | Portfolio / Role | Specific Allegation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ram Sharan Mahat** | Former Finance Minister (Nepali Congress) | Accused of facilitating the initial financial arrangements and soft loan agreement despite knowledge of cost inflation.11 |
| **Bhim Prasad Acharya** | Former Tourism Minister (UML) | Chaired the CAAN Board that approved the inflated revised estimate of USD 215.96 million in 2014\.10 |
| **Post Bahadur Bogati** (Deceased) | Former Tourism Minister (Maoist) | Instrumental in the early phases of the project, facilitating CAMC's entry and bypassing competitive norms. Charged posthumously.11 |
| **Deepak Chandra Amatya** | Former Tourism Minister | Complicit in extending timelines and approving unjustified variation orders.11 |
| **Ram Kumar Shrestha** | Former Tourism Minister | Involved in the finalization of the EPC contract terms that removed safeguards for the state.11 |

### **2\. The Bureaucratic Architects (Civil Aviation Authority)**

The execution of the fraud was managed by the technical leadership within the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN).

* **Pradeep Adhikari (Director General, Suspended):** The central figure in the scandal. He served as the **Project Chief** from 2014 to 2017, the critical period when the contract was signed and the fraudulent earthworks were billed. He is accused of directly colluding with CAMC to certify non-existent works.10  
* **Rajan Pokharel (Former DG):** Accused of ignoring audit warnings and continuing payments to the contractor despite visible irregularities.16  
* **Sanjiv Gautam (Former DG):** Complicit in the failure to enforce design specifications regarding the runway elevation.16  
* **Binesh Munakarmi:** Head of the Pokhara Airport Project; directly responsible for on-site verification of the flawed bills.16

### **3\. The Academic "Launderers"**

A unique feature of this case is the co-option of academia to legitimize the fraud.

* **Prof. Dr. Rabindra Nath Shrestha**, **Santosh Kumar Shrestha**, **Surya Gyawali:** These professors from the Institute of Engineering (Tribhuvan University) were appointed to the cost review committee. They are charged with providing a **"technically baseless"** report that justified the inflated USD 215.96 million price tag, giving the corruption a veneer of independent expert validation.3

### **4\. The Corporate Beneficiary**

* **China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd.:** The contractor.  
  * **Wang Bo (Chairman)** and **Liu Shengcheng (Regional General Manager)** are personally named as defendants for orchestrating the bid-rigging and billing fraud.3

## ---

**MODULE F: CHRONOLOGICAL EVIDENCE**

### **1975 – 2010: The Long Gestation**

* **1975:** The Government of Nepal acquires 3,106 ropanis of land for a regional airport in Pokhara.24  
* **1989-2010:** Various studies by JICA and others estimate the project cost between USD 40 million and USD 100 million. The project remains stalled due to political instability and lack of funds.

### **2011 – 2014: The Setup & The Rigged Bid**

* **2011 (September):** Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun signs an MoU with CAMC, pledging "solid and substantial support" for their bid, creating a non-level playing field before the tender is even announced.24  
* **2012 (February):** CAAN invites bids. CAMC submits the lowest bid at **USD 305 million**, while the government estimate is **USD 169.69 million**. Other Chinese bidders quote even higher, creating a cartel-like pricing structure.4  
* **2013:** Public outcry over the cost leads to a stall. A "Three-Member Committee" of experts is formed to review the cost.  
* **2014 (April/May):** The Committee recommends a revised cost of **USD 215.96 million**. The CAAN Board, under Minister Bhim Acharya, approves this figure. The commercial contract is signed with CAMC.3

### **2016 – 2018: Financing & Construction Start**

* **2016 (March):** During PM KP Sharma Oli's visit to China, the loan agreement is signed with China Exim Bank.  
  * **Terms:** USD 215.96M total; 25% interest-free, 75% at 2% interest.  
* **2017 (July):** Construction officially commences. Pradeep Adhikari is Project Chief.  
* **2018:** Money flows accelerate. CAMC bills for massive earthworks and soil transport. The "cut-and-fill" operation replaces the required external soil transport, but bills are paid as if external transport occurred.11

### **2019 – 2022: The Flawed Execution**

* **2019:** CAMC acquires IPPR, the project's consulting firm, solidifying the conflict of interest.11  
* **2021:** The runway is completed at the incorrect elevation of 2,636 feet.  
* **2022:** With the airport nearing completion, the obstacle issue with Rithepani Hill becomes undeniable. The government is forced to authorize emergency hill-cutting, paying an additional NPR 320 million to a new contractor.17

### **2023 – Present: The Fallout**

* **2023 (January 1):** PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal inaugurates the airport. No international flights arrive.  
* **2023 (June):** The Chinese Ambassador publicly claims PRIA is a "BRI Project," sparking a diplomatic row with Nepal (who denied it) and India.1  
* **2024:** The airport fails to attract regular international carriers due to payload restrictions and India's refusal to grant the Mahendranagar airspace entry.  
* **2025 (April):** The Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Sub-committee led by Rajendra Lingden releases its investigation, recommending prosecution.17  
* **2025 (December 7):** The CIAA files corruption charges against 55 individuals and CAMC at the Special Court.2

## ---

**MODULE G: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS & CHARGES**

The case filed at the **Special Court** represents the largest corruption prosecution in Nepal's history in terms of damages sought.

### **1\. Statutory Basis**

The charges are grounded in the **Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 (B.S. 2059\)**:

* **Section 8 (Damage to Public Property):** Cited regarding the substandard runway and drainage construction.  
* **Section 17 (Misappropriation):** Cited for the embezzlement of the soil transport funds.  
* **Collusion:** The charge sheet explicitly alleges that the accused "acted with malafide intent" to manipulate the cost estimates.10

### **2\. Legal Strategy & Defense**

* **Prosecution Strategy:** The CIAA is relying on the discrepancy between the "Government Estimate" and the "Contract Price" as prima facie evidence of inflation, bolstered by the physical absence of billed earthworks.  
* **Defense Arguments:** The accused, particularly Pradeep Adhikari, have argued that the cost increases were due to "inflation over five years" and "scope changes" (like adding a boarding bridge), denying any misappropriation.22 They claim the soil transport was an "adjustment" sanctioned by the contract's variability clauses.

### **3\. Judicial Relief Sought**

The CIAA seeks:

* **Recovery:** **NPR 8.36 Billion (USD 74.34 Million)** to be recovered from the defendants jointly and severally.  
* **Punishment:** Imprisonment of 8 to 10 years for the principal accused.  
* **Blacklisting:** A formal ban on China CAMC Engineering from future operations in Nepal.25

**MODULE H: GEOPOLITICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

The PRIA scandal has transcended domestic governance to become a geopolitical crisis involving Nepal, China, and India.

### **1\. The BRI "Poison Pill"**

The project has become a lightning rod for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in South Asia. While Nepali officials initially treated it as a standalone bilateral project, China's aggressive branding of PRIA as a "BRI Flagship" has tainted the asset. The revelation of massive corruption involving a Chinese SOE undermines Beijing's narrative of "clean development" and validates criticisms of the BRI as a vehicle for opaque deals and elite capture.1

### **2\. The Indian Blockade (Airspace Denial)**

India's refusal to grant the **Mahendranagar (L626)** and **Nepalgunj** entry routes is the single biggest operational hurdle for the airport.

* **The Issue:** Flights from the west (Middle East, Europe) must currently enter Nepal via Simara (in the south-east), then fly north-west to Pokhara. This adds significant flight time and fuel burn.  
* **The Reason:** While India cites "security concerns" due to proximity to Indian Air Force bases, the refusal is widely interpreted as a strategic lever. By denying connectivity to a Chinese-built project, India effectively neutralizes the airport's utility. This leaves Nepal with a debt-laden asset that cannot access its primary markets efficiently.9

### **3\. Sovereign Debt & The "Debt Trap"**

PRIA is now a financial liability.

* **The Trap:** The loan requires repayment regardless of airport revenue. With the airport generating losses, CAAN must divert funds from other profitable sectors to pay China Exim Bank.  
* **The Precedent:** The situation mirrors the Hambantota Port case in Sri Lanka. If Nepal defaults, there are fears regarding the equity control of the airport, although the loan is sovereign-guaranteed rather than asset-backed. The corruption charges may provide Nepal with legal grounds to suspend payments or demand arbitration, potentially freezing the debt service obligation during the litigation.4
