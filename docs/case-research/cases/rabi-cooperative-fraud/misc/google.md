**1\. Executive Intelligence Summary**

This report constitutes an exhaustive forensic and legal analysis of the cooperative fraud case involving Rabi Lamichhane, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of Nepal, and the President of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The investigation focuses on the systemic embezzlement of public deposits ranging between **Rs 650 million** and **Rs 1.5 billion** from a network of savings and credit cooperatives. These funds were illicitly diverted to finance the operations of **Gorkha Media Network Pvt. Ltd.**, the operator of the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television, during Lamichhane's tenure as Managing Director and shareholder.

The case represents a watershed moment in Nepal’s financial crime history, intertwining high-profile political figures with the collapse of the cooperative sector—a vital pillar of the rural economy. The investigation, culminated by a Parliamentary Special Probe Committee report in September 2024 and subsequent police inquiries across five districts, established that funds from **Surya Darshan (Pokhara)**, **Supreme (Butwal)**, **Sahara (Chitwan)**, **Swarnalaxmi (Kathmandu)**, and **Sano Paila (Birgunj)** were illegally diverted to finance the media house through a sophisticated mechanism of bridge accounts, dummy borrowers, and forged documentation.1

As of December 18, 2025, the legal trajectory of the case has been volatile, characterized by a cycle of arrests, releases, and re-incarcerations driven by conflicting judicial interpretations of the Organized Crime Prevention Act and the Cooperative Act. Following his initial arrest in October 2024, Lamichhane faced charges of cooperative fraud, organized crime, and money laundering. After nearly a year of judicial proceedings—interrupted by brief periods of bail that were subsequently overturned by higher courts—the High Court has recently ordered his release on a historic bail amount of **Rs 268 million** plus additional deposits, reflecting the severity of the financial liability attributed to him.4

This document is structured to populate the Jawafdehi Case Entry Template, offering granular detail on the modus operandi, the financial trail, statutory violations, and the broader systemic failures that facilitated this complex financial crime. It serves not only as a record of the specific offenses but as an indictment of the regulatory vacuums that permitted the "GB Rai Model" of cooperative exploitation to flourish unchecked.

**2\. Systemic Context: The Ecology of the Fraud**

To fully comprehend the mechanics of the Rabi Lamichhane case, it is imperative to analyze the ecosystem in which it occurred. The fraud did not happen in a vacuum; it was the product of a regulatory environment that allowed cooperatives to metastasize into shadow banks without the requisite oversight.

### **2.1 The Cooperative Crisis in Nepal**

Nepal's cooperative sector was designed to be a grassroots economic engine, fostering financial inclusion through member-based savings and credit groups. However, over the last decade, the sector expanded aggressively into "multipurpose" cooperatives that began operating with the complexity of commercial banks but without the stringent supervision of the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). By 2024, the crisis had reached a tipping point, with over **Rs 87 billion** embezzled across 40 major cooperatives, affecting thousands of small depositors ranging from retirees to daily wage earners.3

The "Gorkha Media Network" case is the apex of a specific typology of fraud known as the "GB Rai Model." In this model, cooperative funds were siphoned off to fund private, high-risk commercial ventures—media houses, real estate projects, and herbal industries—owned by the cooperative managers themselves. This practice is a direct violation of the Cooperative Act, which mandates that cooperatives function solely for the benefit of their members and prohibits lending to non-members or investing in private limited companies.2

### **2.2 Regulatory Failure and Institutional Negligence**

The Parliamentary Special Probe Committee's findings highlighted severe systemic failures. The Department of Cooperatives, the primary regulator, was found to be understaffed, technically ill-equipped, and legally toothless against politically connected operators.

* **The Oversight Gap:** While the NRB regulates commercial banks, cooperatives fall under the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation. This created a regulatory arbitrage where billions of rupees in public deposits were managed with minimal scrutiny.  
* **Political Shielding:** The report explicitly criticized the government's negligence, noting that the "state's indifference over time" allowed financial distress to fester. The lack of a functioning credit information center for cooperatives meant that bad actors could cycle funds between multiple institutions without detection.6  
* **IMF Warnings:** The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had flagged these risks, noting in its reports that the collapse of the cooperative sector could have contagion effects on the broader banking system. The IMF advised immediate liquidation and asset transfers for failed cooperatives, but the political will to act was absent until the crisis became undeniable.7

### **2.3 The Rise of Gorkha Media Network**

Against this backdrop of loose regulation, Gorkha Media Network Pvt. Ltd. was established with the ambition of operating a world-class television channel, Galaxy 4K. The leadership structure was central to the fraud mechanism:

* **Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai:** The Chairman and the mastermind behind the network of cooperatives. He utilized his control over institutions like Suryadarshan and Supreme to treat their deposits as his personal treasury.  
* **Rabi Lamichhane:** The Managing Director (MD) and the public face of the channel. A celebrated television personality known for his anti-corruption crusades, his entry into the venture provided it with immense public credibility—credibility that was essential for the station's launch but also served to mask the illicit source of its funding.  
* **Chhabilal Joshi:** The Vice-Chairman and Director. A former Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Nepal Police, his involvement lent an air of authority and security to the enterprise.8

The company had no substantial independent capital. Investigation reports confirm that its entire operational cash flow was derived from the illegal diversion of cooperative deposits. Between the fiscal years spanning Lamichhane's tenure, over **Rs 650 million** was injected into the company directly from cooperative accounts.1

## ---

**3\. The Modus Operandi: The "GB Rai Model" of Embezzlement**

The investigation has uncovered a sophisticated mechanism of financial engineering designed to bypass the Cooperative Act. This was not a case of simple theft but a structured, industrialized extraction of capital.

### **3.1 The "Dummy Borrower" Mechanism**

Since Gorkha Media Network could not legally borrow from the cooperatives (as a private limited company and a non-member), the perpetrators utilized a network of "dummy" borrowers.

* **The Mechanism:** Loans were issued in the names of junior employees, drivers, office assistants, or even the directors themselves. These individuals often had no knowledge that loans were being taken in their names, or were coerced into signing documents.  
* **The Flow:** Once the loan was approved for the dummy borrower, the funds were never disbursed to the individual. Instead, they were transferred directly to the **Gorkha Media Network’s bank accounts at Global IME Bank**.  
* **Evidence:** In the Supreme Cooperative case, loans were issued in the names of various individuals, but the audit trail shows the destination of the funds was invariably the media house.10

### **3.2 The "Bridge Account" Technique**

A forensic audit by the Pokhara Metropolitan City regarding the Suryadarshan Cooperative revealed the existence of "bridge accounts" designed to obscure the money trail.

* **The Mechanism:** An illegitimate account was opened in Rabi Lamichhane's name at the Suryadarshan Cooperative. Funds were moved internally from general savings or other internal accounts into this "bridge account."  
* **The Transfer:** From the bridge account, the funds were then funneled out to Gorkha Media. This extra layer was intended to make the transaction look like a withdrawal by a member, rather than a direct corporate transfer.  
* **Implication:** This evidence is critical because it directly contradicts Lamichhane’s defense that he was "unaware" of the source of funds. The existence of an account in his name, used as a conduit for **Rs 10 million** in one specific instance, establishes a direct link between him and the cooperative's internal ledger.9

### **3.3 The "Sweat Share" Forgery Nexus**

A critical component of the fraud involved the capitalization of Gorkha Media and the validation of Lamichhane's ownership stake.

* **The Narrative:** Lamichhane claimed his 15% stake (180,000 shares) was "sweat equity"—compensation for his intellectual contribution, brand value, and management expertise. He consistently maintained in public that "no money changed hands" for these shares.9  
* **The Forensic Reality:** The Office of the Company Registrar (OCR) records tell a different story. To legally register the shares in Lamichhane's name, the company had to show a monetary transaction. Records show that **Rs 10 million** was withdrawn from Supreme Cooperative (Butwal) on April 18, 2021, and deposited into Gorkha Media’s account to cover Lamichhane's share purchase. Another **Rs 7.5 million** was deposited by Lamichhane personally (sourced from unknown origins).9  
* **The Exit Transaction:** When Lamichhane left the company in June 2022 to enter politics, a sum of **Rs 18 million** was transferred from GB Rai’s account to Lamichhane’s Global IME Bank account (Account No. 0013284037). This transaction was framed as a "share buyback."  
* **The Legal Conundrum:** This transaction disproves the "sweat share" narrative. If the shares were free (sweat), there should have been no cash payout upon exit. Conversely, if he paid for them, he used embezzled cooperative funds to do so. The Parliamentary Committee concluded that "forgery was involved in the purchase and sale of sweat shares," recommending prosecution under the National Penal Code for document falsification.1

**4\. Forensic Financial Audit: The Evidence Trail**

This section provides a granular breakdown of the specific financial evidence linked to each cooperative, crucial for the "Evidence" section of the Jawafdehi Case Entry Template. The data is derived from police charge sheets, the Parliamentary report, and municipal audits.

### **4.1 Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative (Butwal)**

The investigation into Supreme Cooperative provided some of the most damning documentary evidence against Lamichhane personally.

* **Total Diversion:** Documents confirmed that **Rs 150.31 million** from Butwal’s Supreme Cooperative were sent to the account of Gorkha Media Network.11  
* **Personal Transaction (The Rs 2 Crore Voucher):** On **Chait 18, 2077 (April 2021\)**, an amount of **Rs 20 million (2 crore)** was recorded as a loan. The voucher and ledger explicitly list "Rabi Lamichhane" as the reference/borrower. This money was transferred directly to Gorkha Media.11  
* **Share Purchase Financing:** As noted above, **Rs 10 million** was withdrawn on April 18, 2021, specifically to fund the purchase of shares in Lamichhane's name.9  
* **Managerial Complicity:** The cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, processed these loans without collateral under the direct instruction of GB Rai, bypassing all credit committees.11

### **4.2 Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative (Pokhara)**

This cooperative is ground zero for the investigation, with the highest number of victim complaints.

* **Total Diversion:** The Parliamentary Report estimates **Rs 300 million** was diverted, while the Kaski Police Charge Sheet cites a higher figure of up to **Rs 1.5 billion** in total misappropriation involving the network.1  
* **The Lamichhane Link:** A sum of **Rs 10 million** was moved through a dummy account in Lamichhane's name. The audit report by Pokhara Metropolitan City identified this "illegitimate bridge account" as the smoking gun linking the MD directly to the cooperative's internal machinations.9  
* **Operational Funding:** The investigation revealed that these funds were used to pay salaries, purchase broadcast equipment, and cover daily operating costs of Galaxy 4K TV, effectively keeping the station afloat with stolen money.  
* **Victim Impact:** Approximately **19,000 depositors** have been left destitute, with savings ranging from life pensions to small business capital completely wiped out.9

### **4.3 Sahara Chitwan Cooperative (Chitwan)**

* **Total Diversion:** **Rs 117 million** (Parliamentary Report) to **Rs 470 million** (Police Investigation).9  
* **Tracing Difficulties:** Initial police investigations struggled to trace the electronic trail due to server erasures. However, subsequent forensic recovery and bank statement analysis confirmed the flow of funds to Gorkha Media’s Global IME account.  
* **Lamichhane's Defense vs. Liability:** Lamichhane claimed ignorance, stating he had no knowledge of where the money came from. However, as MD, he signed the audit reports that treated these inflows as "loans" or "advances." The Parliamentary Committee emphasized that an MD cannot be "unaware" of the source of hundreds of millions of rupees in a company with no other revenue stream.14

### **4.4 Sano Paila Savings and Credit Cooperative (Birgunj/Parsa)**

* **Total Diversion:** **Rs 100.7 million** transferred to Gorkha Media.2  
* **Personal Liability Claims:** The Parsa District Attorney’s charge sheet is specific and severe. It claims Lamichhane *personally* misappropriated **Rs 15 million** via a loan taken on **August 3, 2021**, at 12% interest.  
* **Membership Evidence:** Contrary to his claim of non-membership, the investigation found evidence that he held a **Rs 100,000 share** in this cooperative, making him a member and thus legally capable of taking a loan—albeit one he allegedly never intended to repay.15  
* **Total Claim:** The Parsa case seeks **Rs 115.69 million** from Lamichhane, combining his personal loan and his share of the corporate diversion.15

### **4.5 Swarnalaxmi Multipurpose Cooperative (Kathmandu)**

* **Total Diversion:** Estimates range from **Rs 640 million** (Parliamentary Report) to over **Rs 1 billion** when aggregated with other Kathmandu-based diversions.2  
* **Judicial Note:** Lamichhane was released on bail of **Rs 6 million** by the Kathmandu District Court in January 2025 regarding this specific case, indicating the court found *prima facie* evidence of involvement sufficient to warrant a significant bond.16

**5\. Parliamentary Special Probe Committee: The Verdict**

The formation of the **Parliamentary Special Probe Committee** in May 2024 was a pivotal moment in the case. Led by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa, the committee was tasked with cutting through the political noise and establishing the facts.

### **5.1 Methodology and Findings**

The committee spent three months analyzing bank records, interrogating stakeholders (including a 10-hour interrogation of Lamichhane), and reviewing cooperative ledgers.

* **The Verdict:** The committee submitted its report in September 2024, concluding unequivocally that **Rs 650 million** was misappropriated from the five cooperatives to Gorkha Media Network.  
* **Attribution of Guilt:** The report stated:"Although Lamichhane has been found guilty of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media Network, it could not directly link him to the rerouting of cooperative funds \[at the source\]." 1  
  However, it clarified that this technicality did not absolve him. As the Managing Director who signed "all but one check," he was responsible for the use of illicit funds. The committee chair, Surya Thapa, famously remarked, "Those in the roles of shareholders, board members and managing director can't evade accountability and liability for the money that comes into the company".1

### **5.2 Recommendations for Prosecution**

The report recommended the immediate prosecution of four key individuals under existing laws:

1. **GB Rai** (Chairman) \- For orchestrating the fraud.  
2. **Rabi Lamichhane** (Managing Director) \- For misuse of funds and forgery.  
3. **Chhabilal Joshi** (Director) \- For complicity in the scheme.  
4. **Kumar Ramtel** (Director) \- For facilitating the transfers.14

This report provided the legal and political cover necessary for the Nepal Police to execute arrest warrants, moving the case from the realm of political allegation to criminal procedure.

**6\. Chronology of Legal Proceedings (2024–2025)**

The legal battle following the committee report has been a protracted drama, playing out across multiple districts and court levels. It highlights the tension between the judiciary's attempt to enforce accountability and the defense's claims of political victimization.

### **6.1 Phase 1: The Arrest and Initial Remand (Late 2024\)**

* **September 22, 2024:** Chhabilal Joshi is arrested in Kathmandu, signaling the start of the crackdown.  
* **October 18, 2024:** Rabi Lamichhane is arrested at the RSP Party Office in Banasthali, Kathmandu. The arrest is executed by the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) and he is immediately transferred to Pokhara (Kaski) to face charges related to the Surya Darshan Cooperative.17  
* **October-December 2024:** Lamichhane is remanded in judicial custody. The police file charge sheets in Kaski District Court, invoking the **Organized Crime Prevention Act** and the **Money Laundering Prevention Act**, effectively broadening the scope beyond simple fraud.19

### **6.2 Phase 2: The Bail Disputes (Early 2025\)**

The early months of 2025 saw a series of conflicting court orders.

* **January 9, 2025 (Kaski):** The Kaski District Court orders Lamichhane's release on a **Rs 2.5 million** bail. The government immediately appeals this decision to the High Court.16  
* **January 26, 2025 (Rupandehi):** In the separate Supreme Cooperative case, the Rupandehi District Court orders release on a **Rs 10 million** bail.10  
* **April 4, 2025 (High Court Intervention):** The Butwal Bench of the Tulsipur High Court, led by Judges Ramesh Dhakal and Swikriti Parajuli, **overturns** the Rupandehi District Court's bail order. The High Court rules that given the gravity of the organized crime charges and the weight of evidence, bail is inappropriate. It orders Lamichhane to be remanded in judicial custody.10  
* **April 5, 2025:** Following the High Court order, Lamichhane is re-arrested in Kathmandu and returned to custody.22

### **6.3 Phase 3: Supreme Court Affirmation (Mid 2025\)**

* **May 23, 2025:** The defense appeals to the Supreme Court of Nepal via a habeas corpus petition filed by Lamichhane's wife, Nikita Paudel.  
* **The Ruling:** A division bench of Justices **Nahakul Subedi** and **Balkrishna Dhakal** quashes the petition. The Supreme Court upholds the High Court’s decision, stating there is "no reasonable basis to believe the defendant is innocent" based on available evidence. This ruling solidifies the legitimacy of his detention under the Organized Crime Act.21  
* **August 16, 2025:** For security reasons and to facilitate hearings in the capital, Lamichhane is transferred from Rupandehi Prison to **Nakkhu Jail** in Lalitpur.23

### **6.4 Phase 4: The Historic Bail Order (Late 2025\)**

* **November 2025:** The legal team files a new petition, arguing that the prolonged pre-trial detention has become punitive. The High Court seeks original case files from the Supreme Court to review the plea.24  
* **December 18, 2025 (Current Status):** In a landmark decision, the Butwal High Court orders Lamichhane's release. However, the conditions are stringent:  
  * **Bail Amount:** A staggering **Rs 268 million**.  
  * **Additional Deposit:** A **Rs 100 million** security deposit.  
  * **Condition:** A written commitment to pay any further liabilities determined by the final verdict.  
  * **Implication:** This order balances the presumption of innocence (allowing release) with the massive financial liability established by the forensic audit (the high bail). It effectively acknowledges the scale of the alleged embezzlement.4

## ---

**7\. Statutory Analysis: The Charges and Implications**

The prosecution has deployed a "cluster" of charges designed to ensure maximum penalty and asset recovery. This multi-pronged legal strategy reflects the complexity of the crime.

### **7.1 Cooperative Act, 2074 (2017)**

* **Section 122 (Offenses):** Lamichhane is charged under subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (j). These sections cover embezzlement, misuse of savings, producing false reports, and investing cooperative funds in prohibited sectors.10  
* **Section 124 (Penalty):** Prosecutors are seeking **6 to 8 years** imprisonment. Crucially, the Act allows for fines equal to the embezzled amount, which forms the basis of the billion-rupee claims against the defendants.2

### **7.2 Organized Crime Prevention Act, 2070 (2013)**

* **Section 3 (Definition):** The prosecution argues that the "GB Rai Group" functioned as a criminal syndicate. Lamichhane, as a key beneficiary and decision-maker (MD), is categorized as a member of this organized group.  
* **Section 9 (Penalty):** This Act provides for an **additional 50%** added to the sentence of the primary offense. If convicted of cooperative fraud (e.g., 8 years), the organized crime charge adds another 4 years, bringing the potential total to 12 years. This statute was key to denying him bail for the majority of 2025\.10

### **7.3 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2008**

* **The Charge:** Prosecutors allege Lamichhane engaged in "layering" and "integration." The funds embezzled from cooperatives (placement) were moved to Gorkha Media (layering) and then used for salaries and equipment (integration) to give them the appearance of legitimate business capital.  
* **Section 30 (Penalty):** Prosecutors are seeking **2 to 15 years** imprisonment and fines double the amount involved. The Kaski charge sheet specifically seeks recovery of **Rs 278.9 million** from Lamichhane under this Act.26  
* **Asset Seizure:** This Act empowers the state to freeze and seize assets, including the "sweat shares" and any property acquired during the relevant period.

### **7.4 National Penal Code (Muluki Ainh), 2074**

* **Section 276 (Forgery):** This charge is specifically related to the falsified documents submitted to the Office of the Company Registrar regarding the share transfer. The investigation found that the cash vouchers used to validate the "sweat equity" were fabricated or manipulated, constituting a distinct criminal offense.1

## ---

**8\. Analytical Insights: Second and Third-Order Implications**

### **8.1 The "Responsibility Paradox" in Corporate Governance**

The core of Lamichhane's defense—"I was just an employee/MD, I didn't know the source of funds"—has been systematically dismantled by the Parliamentary Committee and the Courts. This case establishes a significant precedent in Nepali corporate law: the **"Piercing of the Corporate Veil."**

* **Insight:** The judiciary has signaled that Managing Directors cannot claim ignorance of their company's capital source, especially when the company has no other revenue stream. If a company with zero assets suddenly receives Rs 650 million, the MD's failure to question the source constitutes "willful blindness," which is legally culpable.  
* **Ripple Effect:** This interpretation poses a massive risk to other corporate executives in Nepal who rely on "shadow funding" or informal capital injections. It establishes a fiduciary duty to verify the *legitimacy* of capital, aligning Nepali practice closer to international AML (Anti-Money Laundering) standards.

### **8.2 The Weaponization of "Sweat Equity"**

The case exposes a massive legislative gap regarding "Sweat Shares" in Nepal.

* **Insight:** Lamichhane tried to use the Western concept of "sweat equity" to justify his ownership. However, Nepal's Company Act does not explicitly regulate sweat equity with the necessary nuance (e.g., valuation reports, lock-in periods).  
* **Outcome:** To fit "sweat equity" into the existing rigid system, the perpetrators had to fake cash deposit vouchers. This reveals how antiquated corporate laws can force even potentially legitimate business agreements into the realm of fraud. The "forgery" charge is a direct result of this systemic incompatibility, but it does not excuse the underlying intent to deceive regulators.

### **8.3 Political Fallout and the "Jawafdehi" Mandate**

The "Jawafdehi" (Accountability) initiative is central to understanding the public interest in this case. Lamichhane rose to power on a platform of accountability, promising to clean up the very corruption he is now accused of perpetrating.

* **The Irony:** The investigation peaked only after he became Home Minister and then lost power. This suggests that "files" in Nepal are often kept as political leverage. However, the sheer scale of the evidence—bank statements, vouchers, audit reports—transcends political vendetta.  
* **Institutional Test:** The ability of the court to keep a former Deputy PM in custody for over a year (despite his party's street protests) indicates a strengthening of judicial independence. The high bail amount (Rs 268 million) is a testament to the court's refusal to bow to political pressure, treating the accused as a financial liability rather than a VIP.

**10\. Conclusion**

The forensic analysis of the Rabi Lamichhane Cooperative Fraud case reveals a catastrophic convergence of ambition, regulatory negligence, and criminal intent. The evidence indicates that Gorkha Media Network was not merely a business that failed, but a vehicle designed to consume public savings for private gain.

While Lamichhane has consistently denied direct knowledge of the fraud, the documentary evidence—signatures on cheques, loans in his name, and the receipt of cash for "sweat shares"—creates a compelling case for his liability as a principal actor in the scheme. The recent High Court order releasing him on an astronomical bail amount acknowledges the weight of this evidence while adhering to the procedural rights of the accused.

For the purpose of the Jawafdehi Case Entry, this case serves as a primary example of "White Collar Impunity" being challenged by forensic audits and parliamentary oversight. The ultimate resolution of this case will define the future of corporate accountability in Nepal.
