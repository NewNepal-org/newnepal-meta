This case involves the systematic embezzlement of depositors' funds from multiple savings and credit cooperatives across Nepal to finance Gorkha Media Network Pvt. Ltd., which operated Galaxy 4K Television. Rabi Lamichhane, who served as Managing Director of the media company and later became Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, is accused of misusing cooperative funds through a sophisticated network of dummy borrowers, bridge accounts, and forged documentation.

The Parliamentary Special Probe Committee found that approximately Rs 650 million from five cooperatives (Surya Darshan in Pokhara, Supreme in Butwal, Sahara in Chitwan, Swarnalaxmi in Kathmandu, and Sano Paila in Birgunj) were illegally diverted to Gorkha Media Network. The scheme involved creating fake loans in the names of employees and using bridge accounts to obscure the money trail. Lamichhane claimed his 15% stake in the company was "sweat equity," but investigations revealed forged documents and cash transactions that contradicted this claim.

The case has significant implications for Nepal's cooperative sector, which serves as a vital financial institution for rural communities. Over 19,000 depositors from Surya Darshan Cooperative alone were affected, with many losing their life savings. The scandal exposed regulatory failures and led to nationwide protests by cooperative victims demanding accountability and restitution.

Lamichhane was arrested in October 2024 and spent over a year in custody before being released on bail totaling Rs 268 million across multiple cases in December 2025. He faces charges of cooperative fraud, organized crime, money laundering, and forgery across five districts. The case remains ongoing with trials pending in multiple courts.
