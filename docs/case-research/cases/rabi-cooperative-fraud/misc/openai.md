# Cooperative Fraud Case Involving Rabi Lamichhane (Rastriya Swatantra Party)

**Summary:** Rabi Lamichhane -- a former TV presenter turned politician
-- is accused of involvement in a multi-cooperative fraud scheme in
Nepal. Between 2020 and 2022, several savings and credit cooperatives
across the country (in Pokhara, Butwal, Chitwan, Birgunj, and Kathmandu)
allegedly diverted depositors' funds, totaling around **Rs 650
million**, into Gorkha Media Network -- a private media company
co-founded by Lamichhane that ran the Galaxy 4K TV
channel[\[1\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20consistently%20denied%20any,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
A **parliamentary special inquiry committee** in 2024 found evidence of
these transfers and recommended legal
action[\[2\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20which%20was,initial%20founder%20Chhabi%20Lal%20Joshi).
Lamichhane, who denies wrongdoing and claims political persecution, has
since been **charged with cooperative fraud, forgery, organised crime,
and money laundering** under Nepali
law[\[3\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Legal%20experts%20say%20that%20Lamichhane,parliamentary%20special%20inquiry%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report).
Multiple cases have been filed in different district courts, and
Lamichhane was **arrested in October
2024**[\[4\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Advertisement).
He spent over a year in pre-trial detention but as of December 18, 2025,
**has been released on bail** (Rs 27.48 million bond) pending further
proceedings[\[5\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=The%20Butwal%20bench%20of%20the,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case)[\[6\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=the%20bench%20quashed%20the%20earlier,his%20release%20on%20bail%20instead).
The case remains ongoing, raising questions about accountability for
financial crimes in Nepal's cooperative sector and the political
ramifications for Lamichhane and his party.

## Timeline of Events (Chronology)

- **2019--2020:** **Gorkha Media Network (Galaxy 4K Television)** is
  established by Rabi Lamichhane and partner Gitendra Babu "GB"
  Rai[\[7\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20was%20accused%20of%20diverting,joined%20politics%20in%20June%202022).
  The venture seeks substantial funding for operations. Around this
  period, multiple **savings and credit cooperatives** in Nepal begin
  experiencing financial trouble, later alleged to be linked to
  investments in the media company.

- **April 2021:** **Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative** (Butwal)
  makes a large, irregular payment to Rabi Lamichhane. Cooperative
  records show **Rs 20 million** was deposited into Lamichhane's
  personal Global IME Bank account on April
  2021[\[8\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Of%20this%20amount%2C%20Rs%2020,been%20transferred%20under%20questionable%20circumstances).
  This deposit (minus a Rs 0.4 million service fee) was made via check
  in Lamichhane's name, executed by a cooperative employee (Roshni
  Gurung) at the instruction of Supreme's manager, Sagar
  KC[\[9\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20cooperative%E2%80%99s%20own,service%20charges%20from%20this%20deposit).
  Investigators later determine this was part of a scheme to siphon
  depositor funds to Gorkha Media Network.

- **Mid-2021 -- 2022:** **Cooperative funds continue to flow into Gorkha
  Media Network.** The parliamentary inquiry would later find that a
  total of **Rs 650 million from five cooperatives** (Pokhara-based
  Surya Darshan, Butwal-based Supreme, Chitwan-based Sahara,
  Birgunj-based Sano Paila, and Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi) were
  **diverted into Gorkha Media Network's accounts** during this
  period[\[1\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20consistently%20denied%20any,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
  Lamichhane was the managing director of Gorkha Media at the time,
  holding a 15% "sweat equity" stake (shares granted for his
  role)[\[10\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=media%20company%20that%20operated%20the,joined%20politics%20in%20June%202022)[\[11\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20claimed%20to%20have%20held,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).
  *(Later, allegations of* *forged share transfers* *would surface --
  the committee found that documents for Lamichhane's supposed sale of
  his shares were
  falsified[\[12\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20claimed%20to%20have%20held,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).)*

- **June 2022:** Rabi Lamichhane leaves Gorkha Media Network and
  **enters politics**, founding the **Rastriya Swatantra Party
  (RSP)**[\[10\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=media%20company%20that%20operated%20the,joined%20politics%20in%20June%202022).
  Galaxy 4K Television, however, was already in financial distress -- it
  struggled to pay salaries and eventually **ceased operations in
  2023**[\[13\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=parliament%20which%20was%20formally%20endorsed,the%20basis%20of%20forged%20documents).
  Lamichhane's departure from the media company coincided with his new
  political career (he was elected to Parliament in November 2022).

- **Early 2023:** As cooperatives like Supreme and others fail to return
  deposits, **victims begin to protest**. In April 2023, depositors of
  Supreme Cooperative lodged complaints; the **Supreme Cooperative fraud
  case was first registered at Rupandehi District Court on April 16,
  2023** (3rd Baisakh 2080
  BS)[\[14\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=misappropriation%20of%20funds%20of%20Supreme,president%20Nandkishore%20Pun%2C%20on%20bail).
  The cooperative's chairman, Om Prakash Gurung, was arrested and
  remains in custody, while several other officials (including an
  employee who deposited funds to Lamichhane's account and a former
  vice-president's son) were charged and later released on
  bail[\[14\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=misappropriation%20of%20funds%20of%20Supreme,president%20Nandkishore%20Pun%2C%20on%20bail).
  By mid-2023, a broader **cooperative crisis** became evident
  nationally, with dozens of cooperatives accused of embezzlement. Over
  *10,000* depositors were affected by the Supreme Cooperative alone,
  which had misappropriated more than **Rs 1.12 billion of
  savings**[\[15\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=police%20have%20asked%20Gitendrababu%20Rai,Earlier%2C%20when%20Ravi%20was%20the).

- **August 2023:** **Cooperative victims' protests** in Kathmandu reach
  a peak. After months of sit-ins by depositors demanding their money
  back, the government (Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and
  Poverty Alleviation) signs a **7-point Memorandum of Understanding**
  with protest
  leaders[\[16\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=The%20government%20and%20cooperative%20victims,point%20Memorandum%20of%20Understanding%20%28MoU)[\[17\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=the%20cooperative%20victims).
  The **MoU (August 4, 2023)** promises relief measures: establishing a
  deposit security fund to protect members' savings, setting up a credit
  information center and a special tribunal for cooperative disputes,
  including victim representatives in a reform task force, and pursuing
  legal
  reforms[\[18\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20MoU%2C%20the,deposit%20amount%20of%20cooperative%20members).
  While this calmed protests temporarily, pressure built on political
  leaders to address specific high-profile scams -- including
  allegations involving Rabi Lamichhane.

- **September--November 2023:** The opposition **Nepali Congress (NC)**
  intensifies its campaign linking Lamichhane to cooperative fraud. NC
  leaders accuse the then-former Home Minister of benefiting from
  diverted cooperative funds and **demand a parliamentary
  inquiry**[\[19\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=NC%20has%20been%20obstructing%20Parliament,alleged%20involvement%20in%20cooperative%20fraud).
  NC General Secretary Gagan Thapa even alleges Lamichhane personally
  signed off on transactions rerouting cooperative money into his TV
  company[\[20\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Manish%20Jha%2C%20acting%20spokesperson%20of,the%20report%20confirms%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added).
  Throughout late 2023, NC and other parties obstruct Parliament,
  insisting on a probe committee. RSP and its allies (then in
  government) resist the move, denying Lamichhane's involvement. Street
  protests are announced: NC declares rallies in **Kathmandu, Pokhara,
  and Butwal** -- the cities tied to major cooperative
  scandals[\[21\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20phase%2C%20the,depositors%20be%20returned%2C%20Sangraula%20said)[\[19\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=NC%20has%20been%20obstructing%20Parliament,alleged%20involvement%20in%20cooperative%20fraud).
  In response to mounting political pressure and public outcry, a deal
  is eventually struck in early 2024 to form an investigatory committee.

- **March 6, 2024:** Rabi Lamichhane briefly returns to government as
  **Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister** in a new ruling coalition.
  His re-appointment further galvanizes the opposition. The **Nepali
  Congress, RPP (Rastriya Prajatantra Party), and others** threaten to
  paralyze Parliament unless the cooperative fraud allegations against
  Lamichhane are investigated
  impartially[\[22\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20lower%20house%20formed%20the,formation%20of%20such%20a%20panel)[\[19\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=NC%20has%20been%20obstructing%20Parliament,alleged%20involvement%20in%20cooperative%20fraud).
  According to Lamichhane's later claim, even the Prime Minister
  (Prachanda) and coalition partner (UML) were initially reluctant, but
  he "personally took the initiative" to agree to a probe panel, hoping
  to clear his
  name[\[23\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=March%206%2C%202024%2C%20the%20then,committee%20regarding%20alleged%20misappropriation%20in).

- **May 28, 2024:** The **Parliamentary Special Inquiry Committee** on
  cooperative fraud is formed by the House of
  Representatives[\[24\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%20was%20formed%20on,Network%20will%20also%20be%20probed).
  This **seven-member multi-party committee**, chaired by UML lawmaker
  Surya Thapa, is tasked with investigating *"crisis-ridden
  cooperatives"* -- specifically including those linked to funding
  Gorkha Media
  Network[\[24\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%20was%20formed%20on,Network%20will%20also%20be%20probed).
  The committee's mandate (four-point Terms of Reference) focuses on
  **tracing cooperative funds, identifying responsible individuals, and
  recommending legal
  action**[\[25\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%20was%20formed%20on,Network%20will%20also%20be%20probed).
  It is given 3 months to report. *(A tussle over the committee's scope
  had preceded its formation: NC wanted Lamichhane explicitly named in
  the ToR, whereas UML/RSP preferred focusing only on the cooperatives
  by
  name[\[26\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=The%20task%20force%20has%20not,holding%20three%20rounds%20of%20discussion).)*

- **June -- August 2024:** The special committee conducts an in-depth
  investigation. It summons documents from regulators and cooperatives,
  and interviews stakeholders. Notably, **bank records** are analyzed:
  forensic audits reveal large payments from cooperative accounts to
  Gorkha Media's bank accounts and to individuals associated with Gorkha
  Media[\[27\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Kaski%20police%20claimed%20that%20Lamichhane,he%20disassociated%20from%20the%20company)[\[28\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20defendant%20,sheet).
  The committee's work is extended by 15 days beyond the initial
  deadline to complete its
  fact-finding[\[29\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=investigate%20cooperative%20funds%20embezzlement,Network%20will%20also%20be%20probed).
  Meanwhile, Lamichhane continues to assert his innocence in public, and
  RSP's representative on the committee (MP Shishir Khanal) does not
  file any note of dissent.

- **September 16, 2024:** The **parliamentary inquiry committee tables
  its report** in Parliament, delivering a damning but nuanced
  verdict[\[30\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=In%20the%20year%202024%2C%20a,part%20of%20the%20cooperative%20scam).
  **Key findings:** About **Rs 650 million from five cooperatives** was
  invested in Gorkha Media Network (Galaxy 4K TV) through *"illegal
  diversion"* of cooperative
  funds[\[1\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20consistently%20denied%20any,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network)[\[31\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Committee%2C%20led%20by%20MP%20Surya,different%20cooperatives%20including%20Supreme%20Cooperative).
  The committee concludes that while direct evidence of Lamichhane's
  personal role in authorizing the transfers was not obtained, **he was
  the managing director and a shareholder of the company that received
  the money**, and he **benefited from and utilized** those
  misappropriated
  funds[\[32\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDuring%20our%20investigation%2C%20we%20found,%E2%80%9D)[\[33\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20not%20being,Nepal%20Police%2C%20told%20the%20Post).
  It also finds **forgery and fraud** in the handling of Gorkha Media's
  shares -- Lamichhane's claimed sale of his stake was based on false
  documents, and company officials (including Lamichhane) had used
  **fake transactions and imaginary names** to reroute
  money[\[34\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=he%20said%20he%20sold%20after,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false)[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet).
  The committee recommends the government **prosecute four individuals**
  for these acts: Rabi Lamichhane (ex-MD of Gorkha Media), Gitendra Babu
  "GB" Rai (Chairman/co-founder of Gorkha Media, and also chairman of
  one cooperative), Kumar Ramtel (Gorkha Media board member), and Chhabi
  Lal Joshi (a former Deputy Inspector General of Police and an initial
  founder investor in Gorkha
  Media)[\[2\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20which%20was,initial%20founder%20Chhabi%20Lal%20Joshi).
  An **Interpol diffusion notice** is noted to be active against GB Rai,
  who fled abroad, while another co-accused (Ramtel) was already in
  Nepal's custody on related
  charges[\[36\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=responsible%20for%20how%20the%20money,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody).
  The report is submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire, who **forwards it
  to the government for implementation** on the same
  day[\[37\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=its%20report%20before%20the%20expiry,of%20the%20extended%20time).
  Parliament, in a rare move, **unanimously endorses the committee's
  report** -- a step that effectively acknowledges Lamichhane's
  culpability and urges swift legal
  action[\[38\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Nepali%20Congress,committee%20regarding%20alleged%20misappropriation%20in).
  *(This formal endorsement by the full House was unusual; Lamichhane
  later protested that it was the first time in decades a parliamentary
  probe report was approved without consensus, implying a political
  motive[\[38\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Nepali%20Congress,committee%20regarding%20alleged%20misappropriation%20in).)*

- **October 18, 2024:** Acting on the committee's findings and prior
  investigations, Nepal Police's Central Investigation Bureau **arrests
  Rabi Lamichhane** from the RSP party office in
  Kathmandu[\[4\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Advertisement).
  The arrest is made on charges of **organised crime and
  misappropriation of cooperative funds**, catching the media and
  public's attention as a dramatic fall for the sitting MP and former
  minister. Lamichhane is taken first to Pokhara (Gandaki Province) for
  legal proceedings related to the Surya Darshan Cooperative case. Over
  the next several weeks, while in custody, he is shuttled to multiple
  districts for interrogation and statement recording -- including
  **Rupandehi (Bhairahawa) on November 27, 2024** to be questioned about
  the Supreme Cooperative
  fraud[\[39\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=and%20Savings%20Cooperative%20in%20Butwal,Supreme%20Cooperative%2C%20is%20in%20custody),
  then back to Kaski. Lamichhane later alleges he was deliberately
  overburdened and kept in extended custody by being investigated in
  serial fashion across
  districts[\[40\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Respected%20Fathers%20and%20Mothers%2C%20Now%2C,5).

- **December 22, 2024:** The **District Police in Kaski (Pokhara)**
  formally **file a charge-sheet** against Rabi Lamichhane and dozens of
  others in the **Surya Darshan Cooperative
  case[\[41\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=On%20December%2022%2C%202024%2C%20the,the%20Suryadarshan%20Cooperative%20fraud%20case).**
  The Kaski District Government Attorney's Office registers cases of
  *cooperative fraud*, *organised crime*, and *money laundering* against
  a total of **44 defendants (31 individuals, 8 institutions)**, naming
  Lamichhane as a key
  accused[\[42\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20District%20Government%20Attorney%20Office,the%20Suryadarshan%20Cooperative%20fraud%20case)[\[43\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20District%20Attorney%27s%20Office%20in,as%20to%20confiscate%20their%20properties).
  Prosecutors seek a **15-year prison sentence** for Lamichhane, along
  with confiscation of **Rs 278.9 million** attributed to him in this
  case[\[44\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=the%20Kaski%20District%20Court%20in,the%20Suryadarshan%20Cooperative%20fraud%20case).
  The charges specify that Lamichhane **transferred depositors' funds
  from Surya Darshan Cooperative into his personal bank account and
  Gorkha Media's account** while he was managing
  director[\[45\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=properties).
  Investigators cite evidence of Lamichhane's continuing involvement in
  Gorkha Media's finances even after he ostensibly sold his shares --
  for example, he signed numerous cheques from the company's Global IME

  The charge-sheet accuses Lamichhane of colluding with Surya Darshan's
  chairman **GB Rai** to embezzle depositors' money for personal and
  company gain, including orchestrating **fake transactions under
  fictitious names** to cover their
  tracks[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet)[\[47\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Cooperative%E2%80%99s%20chairman%20Gitendra%20Babu%20,sheet).
  On the same day, under Nepal's **Prevention of Money Laundering Act**,
  the Kaski authorities notify Parliament to **suspend Lamichhane's
  status as an
  MP**[\[48\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Police,in%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Court).
  Clause 27 of the Act mandates automatic suspension of any public
  official once a money-laundering charge is
  filed[\[48\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Police,in%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Court).
  Speaker Ghimire duly publishes a notice of Lamichhane's suspension
  from the
  House[\[48\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Police,in%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Court).
  *(Lamichhane, thus, loses his parliamentary seat duties but remains
  RSP party chairman.)*

- **Late December 2024 -- January 2025:** Lamichhane, still in custody,
  begins facing **court hearings for bail** in the filed cases. On
  **January 9, 2025**, the **Kaski District Court** (Pokhara) grants
  Lamichhane **bail of Rs 6.5 million** in the Surya Darshan (Pokhara)
  cooperative fraud
  case[\[49\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=,confirmed%20ANI%20over%20the%20phone)[\[50\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Rabi%20Lamichhane%20was%20released%20on,related%20to%20the%20cooperative%20fraud).
  Judge Nitij Jung Rana ordered his release on bail after a week-long
  closed hearing, noting that Lamichhane would still need to answer
  charges
  elsewhere[\[51\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=District%20Court%20Kaski%20Judge%20Nitij,the%20plaintiff%20and%20the%20defence)[\[52\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20been%20facing%20cases,won%27t%20be%20released%20from%20jail).
  Indeed, on **January 15, 2025**, the **Kathmandu District Court**
  follows suit, granting Lamichhane **Rs 6 million bail** in the
  **Swarnalaxmi Cooperative** case
  (Kathmandu)[\[50\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Rabi%20Lamichhane%20was%20released%20on,related%20to%20the%20cooperative%20fraud).
  By this time, charges relating to the Swarnalaxmi Multipurpose
  Cooperative (which had funneled money in the scheme) had been lodged
  in the Kathmandu court, and Lamichhane secured provisional release
  there as
  well[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative).
  However, Lamichhane could not walk free yet -- he still faced a case
  in Chitwan that had just been filed, and he remained in detention
  pending that
  hearing[\[50\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Rabi%20Lamichhane%20was%20released%20on,related%20to%20the%20cooperative%20fraud).

- **January 23, 2025:** The **Chitwan District Attorney's Office** files
  a case against Lamichhane and others regarding the **Sahara
  Multipurpose Cooperative (Chitwan)**
  embezzlement[\[54\]](https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/56590#:~:text=,The%20defendants%20include%20Lamichhane).
  Lamichhane is accused of misappropriating **Rs 100.8 million** from
  the Bharatpur-based Sahara Cooperative, which had been **invested in
  Galaxy 4K Television's
  operations**[\[55\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20case%20alleges%20that%20Lamichhane%2C,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds).
  The claim seeks about 7 years' imprisonment for Lamichhane under the
  cooperative fraud statute and reimbursement of the
  losses[\[56\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=responsible%20for%20a%20financial%20loss,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds).
  During the remand hearing in Chitwan, initially the court sent
  Lamichhane into judicial custody (early February), but after
  arguments, **Judge Dayaram Dhakal** on **February 5, 2025** ordered
  Lamichhane's release on **Rs 5.4 million
  bail**[\[57\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20Chitwan%20District%20Court%20has,involving%20the%20Sahara%20Multipurpose%20Cooperative).
  By February 6, 2025, Lamichhane had effectively secured bail in
  *three* cooperative cases: **Kaski (Rs 6.5M)**, **Kathmandu (Rs 6M)**,
  and **Chitwan (Rs
  5.4M)**[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative).
  Earlier, in **Rupandehi (Butwal)**, the District Court had also
  **approved Lamichhane's release on Rs 10 million bail** for the
  **Supreme Cooperative** case (this occurred in January
  2025)[\[58\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=released%20him%20on%20Rs6,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative).
  In total, Lamichhane posted **Rs 22 million** in bail across these
  cases by early
  2025[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative).
  Following these orders, Lamichhane was set to be freed, at least
  temporarily. *(At this stage, the only looming case was in Parsa
  District, where an investigation was ongoing but charges not yet
  filed.)*

- **March 2025:** Even as Lamichhane regained tentative freedom, the
  cooperative investigations continued expanding. Police compiled
  evidence on the **Sano Paila Savings & Credit Cooperative** (Birgunj,
  Parsa) and its links to the scheme. Multiple complaints from Sano
  Paila depositors -- first in August/September 2023, then a large group
  in February 2025 -- had prompted deeper
  inquiry[\[59\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20police%20confirmed%20that,lodged%20complaints%20in%20February%202025).

- **April 4, 2025:** A significant setback for Lamichhane -- the
  **Butwal Bench of Tulsipur High Court** intervenes in the Supreme
  Cooperative case and **revokes the Rupandehi District Court's bail
  order**[\[60\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Lamichhane%20is%20currently%20in%20pre,Rupandehi%20District%20Court%20in%20January).
  The High Court, upon review, decides that Lamichhane should **remain
  in pre-trial detention** for the Butwal (Supreme) cooperative fraud,
  deeming the charges serious. It **remands Lamichhane to custody
  effective April
  4**[\[60\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Lamichhane%20is%20currently%20in%20pre,Rupandehi%20District%20Court%20in%20January).
  This overturned the earlier bail (Rs 10M) he had posted in that case,
  meaning Lamichhane was re-arrested and jailed despite his prior
  releases. He is held initially at **Bhairahawa Prison** (Rupandehi)
  from April, and later transferred to **Nakkhu Jail** in Lalitpur at
  his
  request[\[61\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=Judge%20Narayan%20Prasad%20Sapkota%20had,a%20hearing%20on%20August%209)[\[62\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=With%20the%20order%2C%20Lamichhane%2C%20who,further%20proceedings%20in%20the%20case).
  From this point, Lamichhane would spend the next eight months in
  custody awaiting trial in the Supreme Cooperative case.

- **May 13, 2025:** The **Parsa District Government Attorney's Office**
  files a charge-sheet at Birgunj against Rabi Lamichhane and **28
  others** in the **Sano Paila Cooperative fraud
  case**[\[63\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20District%20Government%20Attorney%E2%80%99s%20Office,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case).
  This case reveals the **largest scale of embezzlement** among the
  coops: police allege **Rs 2.3 billion** was swindled from 5,873
  depositors of Sano Paila
  Cooperative[\[64\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=largest%20sum%E2%80%94over%20Rs1,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu).
  Of that, **Rs 115.6 million** is directly tied to Lamichhane's
  involvement[\[65\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=organised%20crime%20case).
  The Parsa charges show a complex flow of funds: **Rs 100.7 million**
  from Sano Paila was invested into Gorkha Media Network (Galaxy TV)
  when Lamichhane was MD, **Rs 9.6 million** went to a firm called
  Nature Herbs Industries, and an even larger sum -- **over Rs 1.15
  billion** -- was funneled into **Swarnalaxmi Cooperative** in
  Kathmandu[\[66\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=of%20cooperative%20funds).
  (Investigators note that Swarnalaxmi itself was likely used as a
  secondary safe haven or conduit for the stolen
  money[\[67\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20charge,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu).)
  The Parsa case seeks **6 to 8 years' imprisonment** for Lamichhane
  under Section 124 of the Cooperative Act, plus an additional 50%
  sentence under the Organised Crime Prevention
  Act[\[68\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20case%20relates%20to%20the,top%20of%20the%20standard%20sentence).
  By now, Lamichhane is formally charged in *five districts* (Kaski,
  Chitwan, Kathmandu, Rupandehi, and Parsa) on cooperative fraud-related
  offenses. RSP's prominent figures, including former DIG Chhabilal
  Joshi, are co-defendants in several of these
  cases[\[69\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20office%2C%20former,organised%20crime%2C%20and%20money%20laundering)[\[70\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=complaints%20from%20depositors%20in%202023,fraudulent%20redirection%20of%20cooperative%20funds).

- **June 2025:** As Lamichhane remains behind bars, **Parsa District
  Court proceedings** begin in the Sano Paila case. The Kathmandu Post
  reports on June 15 that the Parsa charges have been filed and
  highlight Lamichhane's mounting legal troubles across the
  country[\[71\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20political%20and%20legal%20troubles,to%20pursue%20a%20political%20career)[\[72\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=cooperatives%20across%20the%20country%E2%80%94including%20those,to%20pursue%20a%20political%20career).
  It is noted that he is *"currently in pre-trial detention at
  Bhairahawa prison"* in connection with the Supreme Cooperative
  case[\[73\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=the%20cooperative%E2%80%99s%20daybooks).
  The breadth of the scandal is underscored: multiple cooperatives in
  Pokhara, Butwal, Chitwan, Kathmandu, and Birgunj all link back to
  **diversions of funds into Lamichhane's media
  venture**[\[71\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20political%20and%20legal%20troubles,to%20pursue%20a%20political%20career).

- **August 9, 2025:** The **Rupandehi District Court** (Butwal) holds a
  bail hearing for Lamichhane in the Supreme Cooperative case but
  **denies him bail**, keeping him in judicial
  custody[\[74\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=Lamichhane%2C%20currently%20in%20custody%20over,to%20him%20in%20the%20case).
  Judge Narayan Prasad Sapkota reasons that Lamichhane's alleged
  involvement in embezzling public deposit money is grave enough to
  merit continued detention (Lamichhane had offered a bank guarantee of
  Rs 27.4 million -- equal to the amount attributed to him in this case
  -- but the court still refused
  release)[\[75\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=Lamichhane%2C%20currently%20in%20custody%20over,to%20him%20in%20the%20case).
  Lamichhane's co-accused, former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, was similarly
  remanded. Victims of the Supreme Cooperative scam, many of whom lost
  life savings, were seen **protesting outside the Rupandehi court**
  during these proceedings, demanding
  justice[\[76\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/10/22/supreme-cooperative-victims-protest-outside-rupandehi-district-court#:~:text=Victims%20of%20the%20Butwal,Tuesday%2C%20demanding%20the%20return).

- **August 27, 2025:** In response to an appeal by Lamichhane's lawyers,
  the **Butwal Bench of Tulsipur High Court** orders the Rupandehi court
  to **submit the original case files and a report** on the Supreme
  Cooperative
  case[\[77\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=The%20Butwal%20bench%20of%20the,Rabi%20Lamichhane%20in%20cooperative%20fraud).
  This interim order by High Court Judge Sagar Bista indicates the
  appeal for bail will be closely reviewed at the high court
  level[\[78\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=cooperative%20fraud).
  Lamichhane's legal team argued that since he had deposited the full
  amount of alleged loss (Rs 27.4M) as surety, he should be released
  pending
  trial[\[74\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=Lamichhane%2C%20currently%20in%20custody%20over,to%20him%20in%20the%20case).
  The High Court asks for detailed documentation, pausing immediate
  decisions. Lamichhane remains in **Nakkhu Jail** during this
  period[\[62\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=With%20the%20order%2C%20Lamichhane%2C%20who,further%20proceedings%20in%20the%20case).

- **October--December 2025:** The Tulsipur High Court conducts a series
  of hearings on Lamichhane's bail petition. Between **Oct 30 and Dec
  18, 2025, seven hearings** take place, some delayed at the requests of
  the defense or
  co-defendants[\[79\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=funds%20belonging%20to%20the%20Butwal,and%20another%20defendant%2C%20Chhabilal%20Joshi).
  The prosecution does not seek adjournments, signaling their readiness
  to
  proceed[\[80\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=involving%20Lamichhane%20and%20another%20defendant%2C,Chhabilal%20Joshi).
  Public interest remains high, as the fate of a prominent politician
  hangs in the balance amidst broader questions of accountability in the
  cooperative sector.

- **December 18, 2025:** A major development: The **High Court
  (Tulsipur) orders Rabi Lamichhane's release on bail** in the Supreme
  Cooperative fraud
  case[\[5\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=The%20Butwal%20bench%20of%20the,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case).
  A division bench of Chief Judge Basudev Acharya and Judge Tej Narayan
  Paudel rules that Lamichhane can be freed upon depositing bail equal
  to the attributed loss (**Rs 27.48
  million**)[\[81\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=with%20the%20Supreme%20Cooperative%20fraud,and%20organised%20crime%20case).
  The court notes that Lamichhane had expressed willingness to furnish
  this amount; thus, it overturns the earlier custodial order and opts
  for bail, reasoning that pre-trial detention is not necessary if the
  accused is cooperating and securing the claimed
  sum[\[82\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=required%20amount).
  After the order, Lamichhane is set to be released from Nakkhu Prison
  once the procedural formalities at Rupandehi District Court are
  completed[\[83\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=A%20division%20bench%20comprising%20Chief,after%20furnishing%20the%20required%20amount)[\[62\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=With%20the%20order%2C%20Lamichhane%2C%20who,further%20proceedings%20in%20the%20case).
  This outcome means that by the end of 2025, Rabi Lamichhane is **out
  on bail in all the cooperative fraud cases** against him, though he
  remains charged and will face trial. His release comes roughly 14
  months after his initial arrest.

- **Present (Late 2025):** The cases are now moving toward trial phases
  in the respective courts. Lamichhane, though out of jail, remains
  **suspended from Parliament** due to the money-laundering
  charges[\[84\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=allegedly%20originating%20from%20Surya%20Darshan,to%20be%20of%20illicit%20origin).
  He continues to lead the RSP politically, but the shadow of the
  cooperative fraud allegations looms over his career. No verdicts have
  been reached yet; the judicial process -- involving voluminous
  evidence and multiple jurisdictions -- is expected to extend
  into 2026. Meanwhile, Nepal's government faces ongoing pressure to
  ensure **restitution to thousands of defrauded cooperative
  depositors** and to tighten oversight so that such scams are not
  repeated.

## Key Actors Involved

### Individuals

- **Rabi Lamichhane:** Central figure in the case -- **Chairman of
  Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP)**, former Deputy Prime Minister and
  Home Minister, and formerly **Managing Director of Gorkha Media
  Network** (which ran Galaxy 4K
  TV)[\[85\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20was%20accused%20of%20diverting,joined%20politics%20in%20June%202022).
  He is accused of **misusing cooperative depositors' funds** by
  diverting them to his media company and personal accounts during
  2020--2022[\[32\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDuring%20our%20investigation%2C%20we%20found,%E2%80%9D)[\[86\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20attorney%E2%80%99s%20office%20states%20in,he%20was%20the%20managing%20director).
  Lamichhane has been charged with fraud, organised crime, and money
  laundering in five districts and was incarcerated for over a year
  before securing
  bail[\[87\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Cooperatives%20fraud%2C%20organised%20crime%20and,9%20million%20from%20him)[\[5\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=The%20Butwal%20bench%20of%20the,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case).
  He denies any intentional wrongdoing (claiming he had "no knowledge"
  of the cooperative money in his
  accounts[\[88\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=from%20the%20Suryadarshan%20Cooperative%20to,he%20was%20the%20managing%20director))
  and alleges the case against him is politically motivated.

- **Gitendra Babu "GB" Rai:** Business partner of Lamichhane and
  **co-founder/Chairman of Gorkha Media
  Network**[\[7\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20was%20accused%20of%20diverting,joined%20politics%20in%20June%202022).
  Rai is also a key cooperative sector figure -- notably, he was the
  chairman of **Surya Darshan Cooperative** in
  Pokhara[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet).
  The inquiry found Rai was instrumental in channeling funds from
  multiple cooperatives (including Surya Darshan and others) into Gorkha
  Media[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet).
  An **Interpol diffusion notice** is issued against GB Rai as he fled
  Nepal; he is considered a fugitive from
  justice[\[36\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=responsible%20for%20how%20the%20money,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody).
  The parliamentary report and police charge-sheets identify Rai as a
  mastermind who **colluded with Lamichhane** to siphon depositors'
  money, and he faces charges of organised financial
  crime[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet)[\[47\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Cooperative%E2%80%99s%20chairman%20Gitendra%20Babu%20,sheet).

- **Chhabi Lal Joshi:** Retired Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG)
  and an early investor in Gorkha Media
  Network[\[89\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20which%20was,initial%20founder%20Chhabi%20Lal%20Joshi).
  Joshi (sometimes spelled Chhabilal Joshi) is accused of being part of
  the scheme to misuse cooperative funds. He allegedly partnered with
  Lamichhane and Rai to obtain cooperative money for the media company.
  Joshi has been **charged alongside Lamichhane** in several cases,
  including the Supreme (Butwal) and Sano Paila (Parsa) cooperative
  frauds[\[90\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=The%20local%20police%20department%20of,Gitendrababu%20Rai%20for%20misappropriating%20funds)[\[70\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=complaints%20from%20depositors%20in%202023,fraudulent%20redirection%20of%20cooperative%20funds).
  As a former high-ranking police officer, his involvement drew
  significant attention. He was in Nepal during the investigations; by
  late 2025 he too was in custody, though the High Court's December 2025
  order granting Lamichhane bail presumably applies similarly to Joshi
  (the same order covered Lamichhane "and another defendant, Chhabilal
  Joshi")[\[79\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=funds%20belonging%20to%20the%20Butwal,and%20another%20defendant%2C%20Chhabilal%20Joshi).

- **Kumar Ramtel:** A **board member of Gorkha Media Network** who is
  named in the parliamentary report as one of the responsible
  parties[\[89\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20which%20was,initial%20founder%20Chhabi%20Lal%20Joshi).
  Ramtel was implicated in handling the funds that came into the company
  from cooperatives. The probe recommended he be prosecuted for his role
  in utilizing illegally diverted
  money[\[91\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=It%20states%20that%20the%20bank,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody).
  As of 2024, Ramtel was reportedly already in **judicial custody** on
  related charges (perhaps due to other fraud cases), and his case is
  tied into the broader prosecution of Gorkha Media
  officials[\[36\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=responsible%20for%20how%20the%20money,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody).

- **Ishwari Devi Neupane:** Nepali Congress lawmaker and member of the
  special parliamentary inquiry committee. Neupane provided key details
  to the press about the committee's findings -- for example, confirming
  that **investment in Gorkha Media was made with money diverted from
  various
  cooperatives**[\[32\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDuring%20our%20investigation%2C%20we%20found,%E2%80%9D).
  She has been vocal that although Lamichhane's direct hand in
  transferring the money wasn't documented, he **"has been found guilty
  of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media
  Network"**[\[92\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDuring%20our%20investigation%2C%20we%20found,%E2%80%9D).
  Her statements helped shape public understanding of the case in 2024.

- **Surya Thapa:** Chair of the 2024 parliamentary special committee (MP
  from CPN-UML). Thapa led the investigation and submitted the final
  report recommending
  prosecutions[\[89\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20which%20was,initial%20founder%20Chhabi%20Lal%20Joshi).
  In the report, Thapa emphasized that **company officials cannot evade
  liability for money that comes into their account** from illegal
  sources[\[93\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThose%20in%20the%20roles%20of,UML%20lawmaker%20Surya%20Thapa).
  He noted that since Lamichhane and others **used the money that came
  from cooperatives**, they should be prosecuted under the
  law[\[91\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=It%20states%20that%20the%20bank,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody).
  Surya Thapa's role was crucial in translating the inquiry's evidence
  into actionable recommendations to the government.

- **Lekhnath Dahal:** A lawmaker from CPN (Maoist Centre) on the inquiry
  committee. Dahal highlighted the findings of **forgery** in the
  transfer of Gorkha Media shares and called for further investigation
  and action on that
  matter[\[94\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CForgery%20was%20involved%20in%20the,committee%20member%2C%20told%20the%20Post).
  He is cited as saying *"forgery was involved in the purchase and sale
  of sweat shares"* of Gorkha Media, implicating Lamichhane's claim of
  share sale as
  false[\[95\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=he%20said%20he%20sold%20after,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).

- **Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan:** Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) lawmaker,
  committee member, and former Inspector General of Police. Pradhan
  provided an expert voice on the legal implications. He countered RSP's
  claims of exoneration by stating that **even without a direct
  signature on fund transfers, Lamichhane's actions were illegal**, as
  rerouting cooperative funds to a private company is not permitted by
  law[\[96\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=lawmaker%20and%20committee%20member).
  He stressed Lamichhane *"can be prosecuted for this"* under Nepali
  law[\[33\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20not%20being,Nepal%20Police%2C%20told%20the%20Post).
  Pradhan's perspective underscored that lack of "smoking gun" evidence
  does not absolve the accused when the circumstantial evidence of
  misuse is clear.

- **Manish Jha:** Acting spokesperson of Rastriya Swatantra Party. He
  articulated the RSP's interpretation of the committee report in
  September 2024, spinning it favorably for
  Lamichhane[\[97\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=false).
  Jha argued that the report disproved the accusation of Lamichhane's
  direct involvement (citing that even Gagan Thapa's claim of
  Lamichhane's signature was not
  substantiated)[\[20\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Manish%20Jha%2C%20acting%20spokesperson%20of,the%20report%20confirms%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added).
  He acknowledged the cooperative funds were diverted to Gorkha Media --
  something the party says it had never denied -- but maintained that
  **Lamichhane himself was not directly
  implicated**[\[20\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Manish%20Jha%2C%20acting%20spokesperson%20of,the%20report%20confirms%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added).
  Jha's statements are part of the public narrative battle over the
  case's meaning.

- **Bipin Kumar Acharya:** Treasurer of Rastriya Swatantra Party and an
  associate of Lamichhane. Acharya's bank account was another
  **beneficiary of the fraudulent transfers** -- investigators found
  that **Rs 15.6 million from Supreme Cooperative** was deposited into
  Acharya's
  account[\[98\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=But%20the%20story%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20end,RSP%20treasurer%20Bipin%20Kumar%20Acharya).
  This linkage, revealed in the charge-sheet, suggests Acharya may have
  received cooperative money perhaps to help finance party or media
  activities. His role is under scrutiny, and he is likely among those
  charged or at least investigated for being part of the "web of
  financial
  irregularities"[\[98\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=But%20the%20story%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20end,RSP%20treasurer%20Bipin%20Kumar%20Acharya).

- **Cooperative Officials:** Several cooperative managers and executives
  are deeply implicated:

- *Sagar KC:* Manager of Supreme Cooperative, who authorized the Rs 20
  million check deposit to Lamichhane's
  account[\[99\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=an%20account%20in%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20name,service%20charges%20from%20this%20deposit).
  He is said to have instructed staff to carry out these illicit
  transactions and is a key suspect in the Supreme case.

- *Roshni Gurung:* Employee of Supreme Cooperative who physically
  deposited the Rs 20 million into Lamichhane's bank in 2021 on her
  manager's
  orders[\[99\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=an%20account%20in%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20name,service%20charges%20from%20this%20deposit).
  She later testified to this effect. Roshni was made a defendant for
  her role but was released on a Rs 200,000 bond by the court, likely in
  exchange for cooperation in the
  investigation[\[100\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=was%20endorsed%20by%20Sagar%20KC%2C,While%20the%20investigation%20was).

- *Om Prakash Gurung:* Chairman of Supreme Cooperative. He allegedly
  orchestrated a Ponzi-like scheme at Supreme, accumulating over Rs 1.12
  billion from 10,391 savers and misusing
  it[\[15\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=police%20have%20asked%20Gitendrababu%20Rai,Earlier%2C%20when%20Ravi%20was%20the).
  Om Prakash was arrested in 2023 and remains in jail awaiting
  trial[\[14\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=misappropriation%20of%20funds%20of%20Supreme,president%20Nandkishore%20Pun%2C%20on%20bail).
  His cooperative's collapse sparked the initial wave of protests.

- *Other Cooperative Directors:* Each cooperative involved had its own
  board members who have been named in charge-sheets. For instance, in
  the Parsa case (Sano Paila), a total of 29 individuals are charged
  alongside
  Lamichhane[\[63\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20District%20Government%20Attorney%E2%80%99s%20Office,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case)
  -- presumably including Sano Paila's management. Similarly, the Sahara
  Cooperative case mentions three other individuals charged with
  Lamichhane for the Chitwan
  embezzlement[\[55\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20case%20alleges%20that%20Lamichhane%2C,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds)
  (likely Sahara's officers). Many of these officials (some absconding,
  some arrested) form the broader cast of the scandal.

- **Law Enforcement and Judicial Figures:**

- *Ram Bahadur Kunwar:* Spokesperson for the Tulsipur High Court (he
  commented on Lamichhane's high court
  petition)[\[101\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=A%20single%20bench%20of%20Judge,spokesperson%20for%20the%20high%20court),
  and previously spokesperson for Nepal Police (who may have spoken on
  the CIB arrest).

- *Deepak Pariyar:* Kaski's government attorney who filed the case in
  Kaski seeking 15-year
  imprisonment[\[102\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Pokhara).

- *Judges:* Notably Judge **Narayan Prasad Sapkota** of Rupandehi
  District Court (who denied Lamichhane bail on Aug 9,
  2025)[\[103\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=denied%20him%20bail%2C%20despite%20submitting,to%20him%20in%20the%20case);
  Judge **Dayaram Dhakal** of Chitwan District Court (who granted bail
  Feb
  2025)[\[104\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=Judge%20Dayaram%20Dhakal%2C%20following%20a,once%20the%20bail%20is%20furnished);
  and High Court Judges **Basudev Acharya** and **Tej Narayan Paudel**
  (who granted bail Dec 18,
  2025)[\[81\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=with%20the%20Supreme%20Cooperative%20fraud,and%20organised%20crime%20case).
  Their decisions have significantly affected the course of Lamichhane's
  detention and release.

- *Om Prakash Aryal:* A prominent advocate (not directly involved in the
  case, but an expert voice). He opined that Lamichhane could face
  prosecution under four different laws -- Cooperative Act, National
  Penal Code, Organised Crime Act, and Money Laundering Act --
  reflecting the legal consensus on the charges'
  validity[\[3\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Legal%20experts%20say%20that%20Lamichhane,parliamentary%20special%20inquiry%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report).

### Institutions

- **Gorkha Media Network (Galaxy 4K Television):** The private media
  company at the heart of the fraud. Co-founded by Rabi Lamichhane and
  GB Rai around 2020, it launched Galaxy 4K TV channel, hiring a large
  staff and reportedly burning through cash to compete in Nepal's media
  market[\[7\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20was%20accused%20of%20diverting,joined%20politics%20in%20June%202022).
  Gorkha Media lacked sufficient legitimate capital, so it sought
  "investments" which came in the form of deposits from various
  cooperatives. By 2021--22, **at least NPR 650 million** of cooperative
  money had been funneled into the
  company[\[1\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20consistently%20denied%20any,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
  The funds were used to cover operating expenses, including paying
  salaries and equipment -- effectively propping up the TV channel using
  savers' money. Galaxy 4K shut down by late 2022 due to
  insolvency[\[105\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=cooperatives%20which%20were%20traded%20on,the%20basis%20of%20forged%20documents).
  Gorkha Media Network is now defunct, and its bank accounts and records
  are key evidence in the legal cases. The company itself (along with
  some affiliated firms) is among the "institutional defendants" charged
  -- e.g. **8 companies** were charged in the Kaski case alongside
  individuals[\[106\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20cases%20have%20been%20filed,acting%20registrar%20at%20the%20court).
  Gorkha Media's misuse of cooperative funds is cited as a textbook
  example of corporate malpractice and financial crime.

- **Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Butwal:** A major cooperative
  based in Butwal (Rupandehi) that collapsed after **embezzling over NPR
  1.12 billion** from more than 10,000
  depositors[\[15\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=police%20have%20asked%20Gitendrababu%20Rai,Earlier%2C%20when%20Ravi%20was%20the).
  Its management (Chair Om Prakash Gurung and others) diverted large
  sums to Gorkha Media and associates, including Rs 143 million traced
  directly to Gorkha
  Media[\[31\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Committee%2C%20led%20by%20MP%20Surya,different%20cooperatives%20including%20Supreme%20Cooperative)[\[107\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=of%20money%20from%20the%20cooperative,into%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
  Supreme Cooperative became emblematic of Nepal's cooperative crisis
  when depositors lost their savings. The **"Supreme Cooperative fraud
  case"** now specifically refers to the legal case against Lamichhane
  and others for the funds taken from this Butwal cooperative. It is one
  of the largest fraud cases, and Lamichhane's alleged personal share of
  liability in this case is about Rs 27.4
  million[\[108\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=Lamichhane%2C%20currently%20in%20custody%20over,to%20him%20in%20the%20case)[\[83\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=A%20division%20bench%20comprising%20Chief,after%20furnishing%20the%20required%20amount)
  (with Rs 20 million having gone into his own bank
  account[\[109\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20cooperative%E2%80%99s%20own,service%20charges%20from%20this%20deposit)).
  Supreme's case in Rupandehi is significant as it kept Lamichhane in
  jail the longest.

- **Surya Darshan Saving & Credit Cooperative, Pokhara:** A cooperative
  in Kaski District that similarly failed, with tens of millions in
  depositor money unaccounted for. Gitendra "GB" Rai was the chairman,
  and police say Lamichhane conspired with Rai to channel Surya
  Darshan's funds to Gorkha
  Media[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet).
  The Kaski case against Lamichhane, which seeks recovery of Rs 278.9
  million[\[87\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Cooperatives%20fraud%2C%20organised%20crime%20and,9%20million%20from%20him),
  largely centers on **Surya Darshan Cooperative's losses**. Surya
  Darshan is one of the cooperatives explicitly named in Parliament's
  probe report as funding Gorkha
  Media[\[1\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20consistently%20denied%20any,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).

- **Sahara Multipurpose Cooperative, Chitwan:** A cooperative based in
  Bharatpur, Chitwan, from which **Rs 100.8 million** was allegedly
  embezzled and put into Galaxy 4K
  TV[\[55\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20case%20alleges%20that%20Lamichhane%2C,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds).
  Sahara's link to Lamichhane came via those funds being invested in his
  media company. The Chitwan District Court case (filed Jan 2025)
  accuses Lamichhane and 3 others of defrauding Sahara's
  depositors[\[55\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20case%20alleges%20that%20Lamichhane%2C,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds).
  Sahara Cooperative's collapse affected around 1,600 members (as
  reported in Nepali media), and its scandal became locally infamous in
  Chitwan.

- **Sano Paila Saving & Credit Cooperative, Birgunj:** A cooperative in
  Birgunj (Parsa District) that perpetrated one of the **biggest
  cooperative scams in Nepal's history**, embezzling **NPR 2.3
  billion**[\[64\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=largest%20sum%E2%80%94over%20Rs1,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu).
  It had nearly 6,000 depositors. Sano Paila (meaning "Small Step")
  ironically took a very large step in defrauding members, funneling
  money into various outlets -- chiefly **Gorkha Media (NPR 100.7M)**,
  and an astonishing **NPR 1.15 billion into Swarnalaxmi
  Cooperative**[\[66\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=of%20cooperative%20funds).
  The Parsa case implicates Lamichhane in orchestrating the "fraudulent
  redirection" of these funds with co-accused including Chhabilal
  Joshi[\[110\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20investigation%20into%20Sano%20Paila,fraudulent%20redirection%20of%20cooperative%20funds)[\[70\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=complaints%20from%20depositors%20in%202023,fraudulent%20redirection%20of%20cooperative%20funds).
  Sano Paila's case highlights how cooperatives sometimes transferred
  money to each other (perhaps to obscure the paper trail) -- here
  effectively using Swarnalaxmi in Kathmandu as a repository for the
  stolen
  money[\[67\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20charge,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu).

- **Swarnalaxmi Multi-purpose Cooperative, Kathmandu:** A cooperative in
  Kathmandu valley which appears both as a victim and possibly a conduit
  in the scandal. Swarnalaxmi was one of the five cooperatives
  identified in the parliamentary report as having its funds diverted to
  Gorkha
  Media[\[111\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=formed%20to%20investigate%20crisis,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
  It reportedly received **over Rs 1.15 billion from Sano Paila
  Cooperative** (Parsa) in a mysterious
  transfer[\[67\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20charge,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu).
  This suggests Swarnalaxmi might have been used to launder or
  redistribute funds. Lamichhane faced a separate charge in Kathmandu
  District Court related to Swarnalaxmi, for which he obtained Rs 6
  million
  bail[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative).
  Swarnalaxmi's own management would be under investigation; it's noted
  as a key node in the money flow.

- **Parliament of Nepal (House of Representatives):** As an institution,
  Parliament played a significant role by forming the Special Inquiry
  Committee in 2024 and officially adopting its
  report[\[112\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Monday).
  The opposition's parliamentary tactics (house obstruction) forced
  accountability onto the
  agenda[\[19\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=NC%20has%20been%20obstructing%20Parliament,alleged%20involvement%20in%20cooperative%20fraud).
  The Parliament also has the power to suspend members charged with
  certain crimes -- in this case, acting via the Speaker to suspend
  Lamichhane after money-laundering charges were
  filed[\[84\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=allegedly%20originating%20from%20Surya%20Darshan,to%20be%20of%20illicit%20origin).
  The **Public Accounts Committee** and other parliamentary bodies have
  since kept an eye on whether the government and police follow through
  on the committee's recommendations.

- **Government Agencies:**

- *Ministry of Land Management, Cooperative and Poverty Alleviation:*
  Oversees cooperative regulation. Minister **Ranjeeta Shrestha**
  engaged with protesting victims and signed the August 2023 MoU to
  address the cooperative
  crisis[\[113\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=A%20discussion%20was%20held%20at,Ghimire%2C%20and%20the%20cooperative%20victims).
  The Ministry is tasked with reforming cooperative oversight (e.g.
  establishing the promised deposit security fund and cooperative
  tribunal) -- an institutional response to prevent future
  frauds[\[114\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20MoU%2C%20the,deposit%20amount%20of%20cooperative%20members).

- *Department of Cooperatives:* The registrar **Nawaraj Ghimire**
  participated in the negotiations with
  victims[\[113\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=A%20discussion%20was%20held%20at,Ghimire%2C%20and%20the%20cooperative%20victims).
  The Department is responsible for auditing cooperatives and has faced
  criticism for failing to detect malpractices earlier.

- *Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police:* Led the criminal
  investigation into the cooperative scams. CIB teams coordinated the
  arrest of
  Lamichhane[\[4\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Advertisement)
  and others, and gathered evidence across districts. Their work fed
  into the charge-sheets prepared by district police and prosecutors
  (e.g., Kaski police's 400-page investigation report on the
  cooperatives)[\[115\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=a%20case%20against%2028%20people,is%20After%20filing%20a).

- *District Police Offices:* In Kaski, Rupandehi, Chitwan, Parsa, and
  Kathmandu -- these offices carried out the ground investigations of
  respective cooperatives, interviewing depositors, seizing financial
  records, and compiling cases. For instance, **Kaski Police**
  recommended the multi-pronged charges and calculated the recommended
  sentences for
  Lamichhane[\[116\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=laundering%20charges),
  while **Parsa Police** conducted a detailed audit of Sano Paila's
  transactions (retrieving voucher records, software data,
  etc.)[\[117\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Initially%20investigated%20solely%20for%20financial,GCS%2C%20and%20the%20cooperative%E2%80%99s%20daybooks).

- *District Courts & High Courts:* The judiciary's various levels are
  key actors ensuring due process -- from initial remand decisions to
  bail orders and, eventually, trials on the merits. The **Tulsipur High
  Court (Butwal bench)** in particular had a decisive role in whether
  Lamichhane stayed detained or
  not[\[5\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=The%20Butwal%20bench%20of%20the,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case).

## Money Flow: How Cooperative Funds Were Diverted and Used

Investigations have uncovered a **complex web of financial
transactions** by which depositors' money from several cooperatives was
**illegally diverted into Gorkha Media Network**, benefiting Rabi
Lamichhane and his associates. In summary, **funds were taken out of
cooperative accounts under false pretenses and routed to the media
company (Galaxy 4K TV) or to individuals linked to it**, instead of
being used for the cooperative members' benefit. Key details on the
money flow include:

- **Aggregate Diversion -- Rs 650 million to Gorkha Media:** The
  parliamentary inquiry confirmed that a total of **approximately Rs 650
  million** from five cooperatives ended up invested in Gorkha Media
  Network[\[1\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20consistently%20denied%20any,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
  These cooperatives were spread across Nepal -- notably *Supreme
  (Butwal)*, *Surya Darshan (Pokhara)*, *Sahara (Chitwan)*, *Sano Paila
  (Birgunj)*, and *Swarnalaxmi
  (Kathmandu)*[\[111\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=formed%20to%20investigate%20crisis,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
  Essentially, depositors in these institutions believed their savings
  were safely lent out or invested per cooperative norms, but in reality
  large portions were siphoned off to fund a private television venture.
  This **rerouting violated Nepal's cooperative laws**, which strictly
  forbid using cooperative member deposits for unrelated private
  businesses[\[33\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20not%20being,Nepal%20Police%2C%20told%20the%20Post).
  The money flow was typically concealed through **fake loan documents,
  forged share certificates, and dummy accounts**, as later revealed by
  forensic
  audits[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet).

- **Supreme Cooperative (Butwal) → Gorkha Media:** In the **Supreme
  Cooperative fraud**, around **Rs 143 million** of depositors' funds
  were funneled into Gorkha Media
  Network[\[118\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20Lamichhane,into%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network)[\[107\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=of%20money%20from%20the%20cooperative,into%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network).
  Within that amount, specific transactions illustrate the method:

- **Rs 20 million personal "loan" to Rabi Lamichhane:** In April 2021,
  Supreme's records show a Rs 20,000,000 deposit made to an account in
  Lamichhane's name at Global IME
  Bank[\[119\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Of%20this%20amount%2C%20Rs%2020,been%20transferred%20under%20questionable%20circumstances).
  This sum was withdrawn from Supreme under the guise of a loan or
  investment and directly given to Lamichhane without proper process (no
  collateral or approval as required). It was essentially a payout
  benefiting Lamichhane
  personally[\[8\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Of%20this%20amount%2C%20Rs%2020,been%20transferred%20under%20questionable%20circumstances).
  The Parliamentary committee noted this was done *"without completing
  proper procedural
  checks"*[\[120\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=funds).
  The **voucher for this transfer was signed by Sagar KC**, Supreme's
  manager, and executed by cashier Roshni
  Gurung[\[99\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=an%20account%20in%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20name,service%20charges%20from%20this%20deposit).
  Notably, about **Rs 400,000** was skimmed as "service charge" on this
  transaction[\[121\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20cooperative%E2%80%99s%20own,service%20charges%20from%20this%20deposit),
  indicating even within the fraud there were cuts taken, possibly by
  cooperative officials. This direct deposit into Lamichhane's account
  is a smoking gun linking him to the misappropriated funds.

- **Payments to RSP Treasurer and others:** The Supreme Cooperative's
  charge-sheet details that **Lamichhane was not the sole beneficiary**.
  For instance, **Rs 15.6 million** from Supreme was deposited into the
  bank account of **Bipin Kumar Acharya**, who is the treasurer of
  Lamichhane's RSP
  party[\[98\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=But%20the%20story%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20end,RSP%20treasurer%20Bipin%20Kumar%20Acharya).
  Acharya's involvement suggests that some funds were possibly used to
  finance political activities or reward close allies. Additionally,
  investigators uncovered other **large disbursements to individuals
  connected with the cooperative's management and Gorkha Media**,
  implying a network of beneficiaries. All these payouts were drawn from
  what should have been cooperative liquidity for members.

- **Lump sum investments into Gorkha Media's account:** Beyond personal
  accounts, a considerable portion of Supreme's money was likely
  transferred as lump-sum "investments" or loans to Gorkha Media
  Network's corporate bank account. Police reports confirm that money
  flowed from Supreme's accounts into Gorkha Media's Global IME Bank
  account (where Lamichhane was a
  signatory)[\[27\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Kaski%20police%20claimed%20that%20Lamichhane,he%20disassociated%20from%20the%20company).
  These would have been justified on paper as some form of deposit,
  share purchase, or inter-company loan, but were in fact unauthorized
  and fraudulent.

- **Surya Darshan Cooperative (Pokhara) → Gorkha Media:** Surya Darshan
  in Kaski was another major source of illicit funding:

- Lamichhane is accused of **illegally amassing over Rs 270 million from
  Surya Darshan Savings & Credit
  Cooperative**[\[122\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Cooperative%20fraud%20case).
  The charge-sheet in Kaski claims he failed to disclose the source of
  **Rs 278,944,705** in his accounts, believed to be from this
  cooperative[\[122\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Cooperative%20fraud%20case).
  The mechanism was similar -- deposits from Surya Darshan were
  transferred to Lamichhane's personal or company accounts.

- Importantly, **GB Rai**, the chairman of Surya Darshan, was the common
  link. Rai facilitated moving Surya Darshan's money out under false
  pretexts and into Gorkha Media. For example, funds may have been
  withdrawn in the name of investments or advanced to companies that
  then forwarded money to Gorkha Media. In collusion, Lamichhane and Rai
  allegedly created *"false details, imaginary names and addresses"* to
  mask these
  outflows[\[35\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge,sheet).

- By the time Surya Darshan's troubles came to light (mid-2023), it was
  revealed to have a massive shortfall, leaving depositors stranded. The
  **Kaski investigation** ultimately recommended recovering **Rs 278.9
  million from Lamichhane** as his liability for Surya Darshan's
  embezzled
  sum[\[87\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Cooperatives%20fraud%2C%20organised%20crime%20and,9%20million%20from%20him).

- **Sahara Cooperative (Chitwan) → Galaxy 4K TV:** The **Sahara
  Multipurpose Cooperative** in Chitwan (Bharatpur) similarly diverted
  savings into Lamichhane's venture:

- Over **Rs 100.8 million of Sahara's deposits** were misused and
  **channeled to Galaxy 4K Television's
  operations**[\[55\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20case%20alleges%20that%20Lamichhane%2C,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds).
  Sahara likely "invested" directly in Gorkha Media Network -- perhaps
  by purchasing shares or lending money to the company -- using members'
  deposits.

- Prosecutors say these funds were *"subsequently misused for the
  now-defunct Galaxy 4K
  TV"*[\[55\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20case%20alleges%20that%20Lamichhane%2C,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds),
  indicating the money helped cover the channel's expenses (like paying
  vendors, salaries, or broadcast costs) at the expense of Sahara's
  financial health.

- Sahara's manager or board members presumably collaborated with Gorkha
  Media insiders to facilitate this. By late 2022, Sahara couldn't repay
  its own members, having depleted its reserves via these unlawful
  transfers.

- **Sano Paila Cooperative (Birgunj) → Gorkha Media and Others:** The
  **Sano Paila Cooperative** case reveals a particularly large and
  convoluted money flow:

- Police found that **Rs 2.301 billion** was embezzled from Sano Paila,
  of which **Rs 100.7 million went directly to Gorkha Media
  Network**[\[66\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=of%20cooperative%20funds).
  This was likely done in tranches, perhaps disguised as a series of
  investments or loans.

- Additionally, Sano Paila transferred **Rs 9.6 million to Nature Herbs
  Industries Pvt
  Ltd**[\[123\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20charge,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu)
  (a separate company---possibly controlled by one of the
  accused---suggesting layered laundering; that company might have then
  forwarded money to the media company or elsewhere).

- Most strikingly, **over Rs 1.15 billion from Sano Paila was funneled
  to the Swarnalaxmi Cooperative in
  Kathmandu**[\[124\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=to%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network%2C%20where,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu).
  This indicates an inter-cooperative transfer: Sano Paila's management
  perhaps put a huge chunk of its deposits into Swarnalaxmi, possibly to
  earn high interest or as part of an arrangement, not realizing (or not
  caring) that Swarnalaxmi itself was unstable. It effectively means
  **Swarnalaxmi Cooperative became a repository of a billion-rupee
  hole** from Birgunj. Some of that money may have later gone from
  Swarnalaxmi to Gorkha Media or other uses.

- The Parsa charge-sheet underscores that Lamichhane, along with
  Chhabilal Joshi and others, **played a central role in this
  "fraudulent redirection" of Sano Paila's
  funds**[\[110\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20investigation%20into%20Sano%20Paila,fraudulent%20redirection%20of%20cooperative%20funds).
  It implies they orchestrated or abetted the decisions to send money to
  Gorkha Media and to move money between cooperatives as a cover.

- In total, police confirmed **Sano Paila embezzled Rs 2.3 billion from
  5,873
  depositors**[\[64\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=largest%20sum%E2%80%94over%20Rs1,Multipurpose%20Cooperative%20based%20in%20Kathmandu)
  -- by far the largest single cooperative loss in the nexus. The
  **money flow here demonstrates a laundering technique**:
  cooperative-to-cooperative transfer (Birgunj to Kathmandu) possibly to
  obscure the trail, with eventual use in private ventures.

- **Swarnalaxmi Cooperative (Kathmandu) → Gorkha Media:** Swarnalaxmi
  Multipurpose Cooperative in Kathmandu served as both a source and
  recipient in the chain:

- It was one of the five coops whose money funded Gorkha
  Media[\[111\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=formed%20to%20investigate%20crisis,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network),
  although specifics of its direct transfers to the media company
  haven't been detailed publicly like the others. We do know it somehow
  ended up with Sano Paila's money (1.15 billion) -- which raises two
  possibilities: either Swarnalaxmi was also under the influence of the
  scheme and forwarded funds to Gorkha Media, or it simply became
  insolvent itself with that infusion.

- Since Kathmandu District Court charged Lamichhane in a **Swarnalaxmi
  Cooperative fraud case** (for which he posted Rs 6M
  bail)[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative),
  it implies Lamichhane was accused of **transferring or receiving
  Swarnalaxmi's money as well**. Perhaps Swarnalaxmi invested in Gorkha
  Media or paid Lamichhane under some pretext.

- The Parsa report hints that Swarnalaxmi might have been the final stop
  for a big portion of the loot, so one unanswered question is how much
  of that then made its way to Lamichhane's circle or if it was a dead
  end. Regardless, Swarnalaxmi's collapse adds to the overall diverted
  sum that kept Galaxy 4K afloat temporarily.

- **Modus Operandi -- Fraudulent Documentation:** Across all these
  cases, a common pattern of **financial misconduct** emerged:

- Cooperative officials approved large withdrawals or transfers
  **without member knowledge**, often bypassing required approvals (e.g.
  board or regulatory consent).

- They **forged documents** -- for instance, creating fake loan accounts
  in the names of non-existent borrowers so that cash could be taken
  out, or issuing **fake share certificates** to show the cooperative
  had "invested" in Gorkha Media when in reality it was an unauthorised
  diversion[\[34\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=he%20said%20he%20sold%20after,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).
  The committee explicitly found forged paperwork in the purchase/sale
  of Lamichhane's shares, hinting that backdated or dummy transactions
  were recorded to justify the fund
  flows[\[34\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=he%20said%20he%20sold%20after,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).

- Funds were sometimes routed through **multiple layers**: A cooperative
  might transfer money to a second cooperative or to a front company,
  and then it would go to Gorkha Media or individuals. This layering is
  a classic money laundering tactic to make tracking
  difficult[\[117\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Initially%20investigated%20solely%20for%20financial,GCS%2C%20and%20the%20cooperative%E2%80%99s%20daybooks).

- In some cases, checks were directly issued to Lamichhane or associates
  (**personal cheques**), as evidenced by the lab test confirming
  Lamichhane's signature on Gorkha Media's account cheques used even
  after he claimed to have left the
  company[\[27\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Kaski%20police%20claimed%20that%20Lamichhane,he%20disassociated%20from%20the%20company).

- The money, once in Gorkha Media's hands, was spent on the operations
  of **Galaxy 4K TV** -- a legitimate business use but financed by
  illegitimate means. Salaries, studio costs, marketing -- essentially,
  the depositors of cooperatives unknowingly funded a television
  station. None of the cooperatives saw returns on these "investments";
  instead, they were left unable to repay their own members.

In summary, the **money flow was a siphoning pipeline from ordinary
citizens' savings to a privately run media enterprise**, facilitated by
collusion between cooperative insiders and Gorkha Media's leadership. By
exploiting weaknesses in oversight and using fraudulent entries, the
perpetrators temporarily obtained vast sums. The trail has now been
exposed through audits and investigations, forming the core evidence in
the legal cases. As advocate Om Prakash Aryal noted, this scheme
potentially violates a host of financial laws -- from cooperative
regulations to anti-money laundering
statutes[\[3\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Legal%20experts%20say%20that%20Lamichhane,parliamentary%20special%20inquiry%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report).

## Legal Framework: Applicable Nepali Laws and Potential Charges

Several Nepali laws come into play in this cooperative fraud case,
reflecting the multifaceted nature of the alleged crimes (financial
fraud, corporate misconduct, organised crime, and money laundering).
Below is a summary of the **relevant legal framework** under which Rabi
Lamichhane and others are charged or could be charged, along with the
provisions for penalties:

- **Cooperative Act, 2017 (Nepal):** The primary law governing
  cooperatives. It contains provisions criminalizing fraud or
  mismanagement in cooperatives. **Section 124** of the Cooperative Act
  2017 (as cited in the Parsa charges) deals with embezzlement of
  cooperative
  funds[\[125\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Paila%20Savings%20and%20Credit%20Cooperative%2C,top%20of%20the%20standard%20sentence).
  Under this section, those found guilty of causing financial loss to
  cooperative members through fraud can face substantial prison terms.
  In Lamichhane's case, prosecutors have invoked Section 124 to seek **6
  to 8 years of imprisonment** for him for each cooperative fraud, along
  with the recovery of the embezzled
  amounts[\[68\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20case%20relates%20to%20the,top%20of%20the%20standard%20sentence).
  The Cooperative Act is designed to hold cooperative officers (or
  anyone abetting a fraud) accountable for misuse of members' deposits.
  For instance, using cooperative money for unauthorized purposes (like
  investing in a private company) squarely violates cooperative
  principles and falls under this Act's punitive clauses. In addition to
  jail time, the Act allows for fines or restitution orders. *(Note: The
  exact wording of Section 124 prescribes a base sentence---reportedly
  up to 7 years---and perhaps additional penalties depending on the
  amount misused; prosecutors often ask for the high end of the range,
  as seen with 6--8 year
  demands.)*[\[125\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Paila%20Savings%20and%20Credit%20Cooperative%2C,top%20of%20the%20standard%20sentence)

- **National Penal Code, 2017 (Muluki Ain - Criminal Code):** Nepal's
  general criminal code defines offences like *fraud (cheating)*,
  *forgery*, *embezzlement*, and *breach of trust*, which are applicable
  to this case as well. While the cooperative-specific law covers the
  context of cooperative fraud, the **Penal Code's fraud provisions**
  address deceitful conduct in general. The parliamentary committee
  explicitly noted Lamichhane could be charged for *"fraud and duping"*
  under the National Penal
  Code[\[3\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Legal%20experts%20say%20that%20Lamichhane,parliamentary%20special%20inquiry%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report).
  This likely refers to sections dealing with obtaining property through
  deception or forging documents. For instance, the act of creating fake
  share certificates or loan entries could constitute forgery;
  soliciting deposits under false pretenses or misusing entrusted funds
  could constitute criminal fraud. Conviction under these sections can
  result in imprisonment (often up to several years) and fines,
  depending on the severity. In practice, however, the authorities seem
  to be focusing on the Cooperative Act and Money Laundering Act for
  Lamichhane, perhaps because those laws have more specific or stringent
  provisions for this scenario. Nonetheless, some co-defendants (like
  cooperative officials) might face Penal Code charges (e.g. **forgery**
  was highlighted: using *"forged documents while transferring the
  company's
  shares"*[\[94\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CForgery%20was%20involved%20in%20the,committee%20member%2C%20told%20the%20Post)
  is a Penal Code offence).

- **Organised Crime Prevention Act, 2013:** Formally the Organised Crime
  Control Act 2013, this law targets crimes conducted by an *organized
  group or network*. It is being applied here because the cooperative
  scam was not the work of a single person -- it involved coordination
  among multiple individuals (cooperative managers, investors, possibly
  politicians) across different institutions, which qualifies as an
  organised crime ring. Under this Act, if a person is convicted of a
  predicate offence (like fraud) that was committed as part of an
  organized crime group, the punishment can be enhanced. Specifically,
  the law **allows for an additional 50% of the prison term to be added
  on top of the base
  sentence**[\[126\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge%20sheet%2C%20filed%20on,top%20of%20the%20standard%20sentence).
  We see this in the charges: prosecutors have sought the extra 50% jail
  term for Lamichhane under this Act, in addition to the standard fraud
  sentence[\[125\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Paila%20Savings%20and%20Credit%20Cooperative%2C,top%20of%20the%20standard%20sentence).
  For example, if cooperative fraud yields a 6-year sentence, the
  Organised Crime Act could raise it to 9 years. The rationale is to
  deter collaborative criminal enterprises. The Parsa charge sheet
  explicitly mentions adding the 50% penalty for organised crime
  involvement[\[126\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20charge%20sheet%2C%20filed%20on,top%20of%20the%20standard%20sentence).
  The invocation of this Act underscores that authorities view the
  cooperative fraud not as isolated incidents but as a coordinated
  scheme (potentially even meeting the definition of *organized crime*
  under international conventions).

- **Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2008:** This Act (often referred
  to as the Anti-Money Laundering Act) criminalizes the act of *money
  laundering* -- i.e., processing the proceeds of crime to disguise
  their illicit origin. In context, once cooperative funds were stolen
  (which is the predicate crime), the subsequent transfers through bank
  accounts and different entities to integrate that money into the
  economy can be prosecuted as money laundering. Lamichhane faces
  charges under this Act because he **received and handled large sums of
  money of suspicious origin (cooperative deposits)** and allegedly did
  not satisfactorily account for
  them[\[122\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Cooperative%20fraud%20case).
  A key accusation is that he *"has not disclosed the source of NRs
  278,944,705 which is considered to be of illicit
  origin"*[\[127\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=He%20is%20accused%20of%20illegally,to%20be%20of%20illicit%20origin)
  -- a classic money laundering indicator. The penalties under the Money
  Laundering Prevention Act are severe: depending on the amount, one can
  face **2 to 15 years of imprisonment** and a fine up to **twice the
  amount of money
  laundered**[\[128\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=laundering%20charges).
  In Lamichhane's case, police recommended the maximum: for the
  laundering of roughly Rs 270+ million, they suggested **2--15 years
  prison plus a fine of double the amount
  laundered**[\[128\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=laundering%20charges).
  Another consequence of being charged under this Act is the **automatic
  suspension from public office** (as noted, Clause 27 led to
  Lamichhane's suspension from Parliament upon filing of
  charges)[\[48\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Police,in%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Court).
  The Act has mechanisms for freezing assets as well, meaning any
  property or bank accounts traced as containing laundered funds can be
  seized by authorities. The money laundering angle elevates the case
  from just a breach of cooperative trust to a serious financial crime
  in the eyes of the law, aligning it with global standards for tackling
  illicit financial flows.

- **Other Relevant Laws:** There are a few additional legal angles, even
  if not explicitly charged yet:

- *Company Act:* Since Gorkha Media Network is a company, any
  **misrepresentation in its share transactions or capital structure**
  could violate the Company Act. The parliamentary probe noted issues
  with "sweat shares" and their fake
  transfer[\[11\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20claimed%20to%20have%20held,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).
  Actions like forging share certificates or failing to maintain
  truthful company records can incur penalties under corporate law.
  Lamichhane claimed to have only sweat equity (15%) which he sold
  legally, but that claim was found
  false[\[11\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20claimed%20to%20have%20held,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false)
  -- possibly implicating Company Act violations. However, such charges
  would likely be secondary to the more serious ones above.

- *Banking Offences Act:* Writing bad cheques or misusing bank
  instruments might come up; for example, Lamichhane issuing cheques
  from Gorkha Media's account even after leaving the company could be
  seen as a banking offence if done
  illicitly[\[27\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Kaski%20police%20claimed%20that%20Lamichhane,he%20disassociated%20from%20the%20company).
  Nepal has specific laws punishing cheque bounce or fraud, though these
  are probably rolled into the fraud charges already.

- *Civil Liabilities:* Apart from criminal law, victims (depositors)
  have civil remedies -- they could sue for recovery of their funds. The
  government formed a task force to ensure repayments, and a **Credit
  and Deposit Security Fund** is to be
  created[\[114\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20MoU%2C%20the,deposit%20amount%20of%20cooperative%20members).
  Those are administrative fixes rather than laws, but they will operate
  under the Cooperative Act's framework (which might be amended to
  improve regulation and provide insurance of deposits up to a limit).

In summary, the case spans **four major legal domains**, as succinctly
pointed out by advocate Om Prakash Aryal: *"Lamichhane could be charged
\[in\] the cooperative fraud case under the Cooperative Act, fraud and
duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the
Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering under the
Prevention of Money Laundering
Act."*[\[3\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Legal%20experts%20say%20that%20Lamichhane,parliamentary%20special%20inquiry%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report).
Indeed, Nepali prosecutors have applied each of these, crafting a
multifaceted charge to cover all aspects of the alleged wrongdoing. If
convicted on all counts, Lamichhane and his co-defendants could face
**decades in prison and hefty financial penalties**. For example, police
computations in one charge-sheet envisioned: 4--6 years for cooperative
fraud + 50% extra for organized crime + up to 15 years for money
laundering, plus
fines[\[116\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=laundering%20charges)
-- potentially over 20 years imprisonment in total. However, it will be
up to the courts to determine guilt and appropriate sentencing based on
evidence.

## Investigation and Accountability Measures

### Parliamentary Special Inquiry Committee (2024) and Its Aftermath

The formation of the parliamentary special committee was a **pivotal
accountability step**, prompted by political opposition and public
pressure. Once established in May 2024, the **House inquiry panel** took
its job seriously, conducting a thorough investigation that greatly
advanced the case. Its contributions to accountability include:

- **Bringing Facts to Light:** The committee compelled the production of
  financial records, questioned cooperative regulators, and liaised with
  law enforcement to piece together the money trail. The final report,
  submitted in September 2024, publicly documented the scale of the
  fraud -- naming the cooperatives involved, the total sum diverted (Rs
  650 million+), and the individuals
  responsible[\[1\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Lamichhane%20has%20consistently%20denied%20any,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network)[\[89\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20which%20was,initial%20founder%20Chhabi%20Lal%20Joshi).
  By doing so under Parliament's authority, it validated the claims of
  cooperative victims and removed any ambiguity that the case was merely
  a rumor or opposition smear. The report served almost as an official
  indictment and guided investigators on where to focus. It also
  unearthed **new information** -- like the fact that *five*
  cooperatives were involved (not just one or two), and the specific
  roles of Gorkha Media's shareholders in misusing
  funds[\[111\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=formed%20to%20investigate%20crisis,to%20the%20Gorkha%20Media%20Network)[\[93\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThose%20in%20the%20roles%20of,UML%20lawmaker%20Surya%20Thapa).

- **Recommendations for Prosecution:** Crucially, the committee didn't
  stop at fact-finding; it explicitly recommended the government
  **prosecute Rabi Lamichhane and three associates (GB Rai, Kumar
  Ramtel, Chhabi Lal Joshi)** under prevailing
  laws[\[2\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20committee%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20which%20was,initial%20founder%20Chhabi%20Lal%20Joshi)[\[91\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=It%20states%20that%20the%20bank,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody).
  This was a call to action. It also suggested further investigation
  into the **forgery of share transfer documents** and urged the
  government to tighten laws regarding share sales and "sweat equity" to
  prevent such abuse in the
  future[\[129\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=The%20probe%20panel%20has%20also,for%20share%20purchases%20and%20sales)[\[34\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=he%20said%20he%20sold%20after,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).
  The Speaker of the House, Devraj Ghimire, promptly **forwarded the
  report to the government for implementation** on September 18,
  2024[\[37\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=its%20report%20before%20the%20expiry,of%20the%20extended%20time).
  In parliamentary practice, this forwarding and the House's endorsement
  signaled a consensus that the findings were credible and needed to be
  acted upon by law enforcement and the executive branch. The Home
  Ministry and police were effectively instructed to follow up.
  (Lamichhane later complained this was done with unusual speed and
  resolve, implying he felt
  targeted[\[38\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Nepali%20Congress,committee%20regarding%20alleged%20misappropriation%20in).)

- **Political Oversight and Pressure:** The mere existence of the
  special committee and its high-profile report put enormous pressure on
  Nepal's institutions to act. Prior to this, there were accusations
  that authorities were slow or reluctant to move against a sitting MP
  and popular figure. But with Parliament itself acknowledging
  wrongdoing, any inaction could be seen as defying the legislature and
  betraying the public. The main opposition NC and others kept up
  scrutiny, with NC even declaring that if the government didn't act on
  the report, they would launch fresh protests. This climate ensured
  that by October 2024, investigative agencies accelerated their work --
  culminating in Lamichhane's arrest by the
  CIB[\[4\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Advertisement).
  In essence, the parliamentary probe served as a catalyst that
  transformed what might have been a protracted or stalled investigation
  into a priority case with clear political backing for prosecution.

- **Follow-up in Parliament:** After the report, Parliament's role did
  not end. Parliamentarians continued to raise questions about the
  progress of cases and the status of victim compensation. For example,
  the issue of cooperative scams was discussed in subsequent House
  sessions to ensure that not only Lamichhane but **all cooperative
  frauds** (there were many across the country) were being addressed.
  The opposition demanded regular updates. Moreover, the Public Accounts
  Committee (another House committee) can examine government steps on
  the MoU with victims and financial management reforms. The special
  committee's work also indirectly spurred the government to allocate
  resources to the police for complex financial investigations, as the
  case was now under national spotlight.

In summary, the parliamentary special inquiry was a turning point that
**enhanced accountability** by publicly identifying culprits and
instructing the government to pursue legal action. It demonstrated
cross-party consensus (except RSP) that the rule of law must apply to
all, even a rising political star. The committee's findings laid the
groundwork for the legal cases, and its existence was a product of
Nepal's democratic checks and balances responding to citizen grievances.

### Criminal Investigations, Arrests, and Legal Actions

After the parliamentary report, Nepal's law enforcement and justice
system took a series of concrete steps to hold those involved
accountable:

- **Arrests and Custody:** Rabi Lamichhane's arrest on October 18, 2024
  by the Central Investigation Bureau was the most high-profile
  action[\[4\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=Advertisement).
  It showed that authorities were willing to deprive a powerful
  politician of liberty pending investigation, which sent a strong
  message. Prior to him, *hundreds of others had been arrested* in the
  cooperative fraud crackdown -- in fact, **over 600 people were
  arrested in various cooperative fraud cases even before Lamichhane's
  arrest**[\[130\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/over-600-people-arrested-in-cooperative-fraud-cases-before-rabi-lamichhane-6717060839c7d.html#:~:text=,charges%20of%20embezzling%20and).
  These included numerous cooperative founders and managers across the
  country. For instance, the chairman of Supreme Cooperative (Om Prakash
  Gurung) was arrested in early 2023, and many from coops like Oriental,
  Lalita, etc., were detained as the government formed a special task
  force on cooperative issues. So by the time Lamichhane was
  apprehended, the police had developed a template of targeting
  cooperative scammers; Lamichhane was simply the highest-profile
  individual in that net. His co-accused like Kumar Ramtel was already
  in
  custody[\[131\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=from%20various%20cooperatives%2C%20we%20recommend,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody),
  and others such as some Supreme Cooperative staff were arrested and
  later bailed as they
  cooperated[\[100\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=was%20endorsed%20by%20Sagar%20KC%2C,While%20the%20investigation%20was).
  Former DIG Chhabilal Joshi surrendered or was arrested (he appeared in
  court as well), and he was held during proceedings (Chitwan Court, for
  example, initially remanded Joshi along with
  Lamichhane)[\[132\]](https://theannapurnaexpress.com/story/52241/#:~:text=custody%20theannapurnaexpress,Lamichhane%20was).
  In essence, the **criminal justice system treated this as a major
  financial crime**, jailing key suspects to prevent evidence tampering
  or flight. Lamichhane's transfer to different jails (Bhairahawa, then
  Nakkhu) under security watch ensured he couldn't easily influence the
  investigation.

- **Multi-District Charge-Sheets:** Recognizing that the fraud spanned
  multiple jurisdictions, Nepal's prosecutors filed **cases in each
  affected district** rather than trying to bundle everything in
  Kathmandu. This meant:

- **Kaski District Court case (Dec 2024):** charging 44 defendants,
  including Lamichhane, with detailed allegations on Surya Darshan coop
  and related
  funds[\[42\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20District%20Government%20Attorney%20Office,the%20Suryadarshan%20Cooperative%20fraud%20case).

- **Kathmandu District Court case (late 2024):** covering Swarnalaxmi
  coop transactions -- Lamichhane and others were arraigned, leading to
  his bail on Jan 15,
  2025[\[50\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Rabi%20Lamichhane%20was%20released%20on,related%20to%20the%20cooperative%20fraud).

  2025[\[55\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=The%20case%20alleges%20that%20Lamichhane%2C,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds)[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative).

- **Rupandehi District Court case:** initial case filed April 2023
  against coop officials, then a **supplementary charge-sheet in January
  2025** adding Lamichhane and 13 others with a total claim of Rs 1.12
  billion[\[133\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=%2A%20A%20case%20of%20co,the%20embezzlement%20of%20Supreme%27s%20funds)[\[90\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=The%20local%20police%20department%20of,Gitendrababu%20Rai%20for%20misappropriating%20funds).
  The supplementary case sought **Rs 84.1 million** in liability from
  Lamichhane and Joshi combined (the wording suggests roughly Rs 40
  million individually from Lamichhane,
  etc.)[\[134\]](https://ekantipur.com/news/2025/01/16/en/supreme-cooperative-fraud-case-a-case-is-being-registered-in-rupandehi-district-court-with-a-claim-of-rs-841-million-against-ravi-and-chabi-19-40.html#:~:text=the%20opinion%20that%2042%20people,police%20included%20in%20the%20report).
  This case took longer to proceed due to the bail revocation issues.

- **Parsa District Court case (May 2025):** against Lamichhane and 28
  others, focusing on Sano Paila coop's massive
  fraud[\[63\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=The%20District%20Government%20Attorney%E2%80%99s%20Office,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case).

Each charge-sheet not only pressed criminal charges but also included
**claims for restitution** -- demanding that the accused repay the
amounts siphoned. For example, Kaski's asked recovery of Rs 278.9M from
Lamichhane[\[87\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Cooperatives%20fraud%2C%20organised%20crime%20and,9%20million%20from%20him);
Parsa's sought Rs 115.6M from him (and similarly from
others)[\[65\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=organised%20crime%20case);
Chitwan's insisted on restitution of Lamichhane's share of the Rs 100.8M
loss[\[56\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=responsible%20for%20a%20financial%20loss,share%20of%20the%20embezzled%20funds).
This approach is aimed at eventually compensating victims if the courts
seize the defendants' assets or if fines are paid (however, it's
uncertain how much can actually be recovered).

- **Judicial Oversight -- Bail and Detention Decisions:** The court
  system's handling of Lamichhane's bail has been both strict and fair,
  demonstrating accountability but also rule of law:

- Initially, Lamichhane was **remanded in custody** (no bail) in the
  immediate aftermath of his arrest in Pokhara, indicating the
  seriousness with which the courts treated the allegations. Chitwan
  District Court also at first remanded him (early Feb 2025) before
  granting bail
  later[\[135\]](https://theannapurnaexpress.com/story/52241/#:~:text=Chitwan%20District%20Court%20sends%20RSP,Lamichhane%20was).

- The fact that some courts granted bail (Kaski, Kathmandu, Chitwan,
  Rupandehi initially) shows the judiciary wasn't uncompromising; they
  assessed that Lamichhane was an MP who might not abscond and allowed
  temporary release against large monetary
  guarantees[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative).
  This was in line with Nepali law which generally prefers bail unless
  there's a flight risk or risk of hampering investigation.

- However, the **High Court's intervention in April 2025 to cancel
  bail** in the Supreme case shows judicial vigilance -- essentially,
  the High Court found the Rupandehi District Court may have erred in
  releasing him, so they corrected
  it[\[60\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2025/06/15/parsa-attorney-files-fraud-and-organised-crime-case-against-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Lamichhane%20is%20currently%20in%20pre,Rupandehi%20District%20Court%20in%20January).
  This unusual step (revoking bail of a political figure) underscored
  that accountability comes before leniency in a case of this magnitude.
  The High Court must have been convinced by arguments that Lamichhane's
  influence or the gravity of the crime warranted custody.

- Finally, by Dec 2025, the High Court again stepped in, this time to
  ensure due process rights -- granting bail after lengthy
  hearings[\[81\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=with%20the%20Supreme%20Cooperative%20fraud,and%20organised%20crime%20case).
  The High Court's detailed consideration (seven hearings) and
  requirement that Lamichhane deposit the full Rs 27.4M alleged loss as
  bond[\[83\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=A%20division%20bench%20comprising%20Chief,after%20furnishing%20the%20required%20amount)
  reflect a balance: securing the victims' interests financially while
  allowing the accused to be free during trial. It also likely took into
  account that investigations were complete and evidence secured,
  reducing the risk of tampering.

- Throughout, the courts have allowed both prosecution and defense to
  present arguments (with even postponements granted to defense to
  prepare)[\[79\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=funds%20belonging%20to%20the%20Butwal,and%20another%20defendant%2C%20Chhabilal%20Joshi),
  showing adherence to legal procedure. This transparency in judicial
  proceedings is an accountability mechanism itself, reassuring the
  public that the case is being handled on its merits.

- **Suspension from Parliament:** As mentioned, the enforcement of
  Clause 27 of the Money Laundering Act to **suspend Lamichhane's MP
  status** was a significant accountability
  measure[\[48\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Police,in%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Court).
  It meant that from late Dec 2024 onward, Lamichhane could not sit in
  Parliament or draw a salary as an MP, pending the resolution of the
  case. This is automatic but required prompt action by officials;
  Speaker Ghimire did so by issuing a
  notice[\[48\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Police,in%20the%20Kaski%20District%20Court).
  It prevented any conflict of interest where Lamichhane as a lawmaker
  might influence the process or use parliamentary immunity (Nepal's MPs
  do have some protections, but not for criminal cases of this nature).
  In essence, the system self-corrected to ensure he faced justice as a
  private citizen rather than hiding behind political office.

- **Institutional Reforms and Victim Relief:** In parallel with the
  criminal proceedings, the government has undertaken some steps to
  address the systemic issues revealed:

- The **7-point MoU in August 2023** (between the Ministry and
  cooperative victims) is being implemented, albeit slowly. For
  accountability, one key point is the creation of a **"Savings and
  Credit Security
  Fund"**[\[114\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20MoU%2C%20the,deposit%20amount%20of%20cooperative%20members)
  -- a sort of deposit insurance for cooperatives. If instituted, this
  would guarantee at least partial repayment to members even if a
  cooperative fails due to fraud. By late 2025, the fund's status is
  unclear, but the commitment is on record.

- Plans for a **Credit Information Center** and a **Cooperative
  Tribunal** have been
  mooted[\[114\]](https://aawaajnews.com/updates/cooperative-victims-and-government-sign-mou-after-months-of-protest/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20MoU%2C%20the,deposit%20amount%20of%20cooperative%20members).
  A credit information center would function like a credit bureau,
  tracking cooperative loans to detect anomalies (like large loans to
  single entities -- which happened in this scam). A
  cooperative-specific tribunal could expedite legal cases and disputes
  in the sector, avoiding delays in normal courts.

- The government also formed a **High-Level Commission** in 2023 to
  examine all troubled cooperatives and recommend solutions for
  compensating depositors. This commission, separate from the
  parliamentary one, has been cataloguing the liabilities of various
  failed cooperatives (which run into tens of billions of rupees
  nationally). Its recommendations may lead to budgetary allocations to
  pay back victims over time or auctioning assets of defaulters. While
  not specific to Lamichhane's case, this is part of the broader
  accountability and remedy process for the cooperative crisis he's part
  of.

- Law enforcement has also continued to pursue **other cooperative
  scams** relentlessly -- as noted, more than 600 individuals
  (cooperative operators) were arrested in connection with frauds
  *before* Lamichhane's case gained
  steam[\[130\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/over-600-people-arrested-in-cooperative-fraud-cases-before-rabi-lamichhane-6717060839c7d.html#:~:text=,charges%20of%20embezzling%20and).
  This indicates that the police did not treat it as one man's
  persecution but as a general crackdown. In fact, by mid-2025,
  authorities boasted that they had acted on nearly all major
  cooperative fraud complaints, to show that **no one is above the law**
  and to restore trust in the system.

- **Special Oversight Committee (Political):** In mid-2025, with
  Lamichhane in jail and RSP in opposition, there were murmurs in
  Parliament about ensuring the case is not politically interfered with.
  RSP at one point demanded a parliamentary committee to look into
  alleged "misuse of laws" against Lamichhane, but this did not gain
  traction as other parties felt the legal process should run its
  course. Instead, in some instances, parliamentary committees like the
  Law and Justice Committee have reviewed whether enforcement agencies
  are adhering to legal norms. For example, there was a check on whether
  the police respected custody time limits and whether the courts
  properly registered documents (especially after some case files were
  reported missing during protests, though that was
  separate)[\[77\]](https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2025/08/27/high-court-orders-submission-of-original-files-in-rabi-lamichhane-case#:~:text=The%20Butwal%20bench%20of%20the,Rabi%20Lamichhane%20in%20cooperative%20fraud)[\[79\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=funds%20belonging%20to%20the%20Butwal,and%20another%20defendant%2C%20Chhabilal%20Joshi).
  By and large, however, the focus remained on the judiciary and
  investigators to do their jobs.

Overall, **accountability has been pursued on multiple fronts**: the
legislative (special committee, new laws/reforms), the executive (police
investigations, arrests), and the judicial (trials, bail/suspension
decisions). The interplay of these fronts in Lamichhane's case
demonstrates Nepal's institutional response to corruption scandals. It
is a test of whether political connections trump accountability or vice
versa. As of now, the process -- albeit slow -- has held Lamichhane to
account by subjecting him to the full rigor of investigation and
prosecution, much like any other suspect. The upcoming trials will
further test this, as verdicts will have to be rendered purely on
evidence. The special committee's report and the thorough police work
have set the stage for eventual accountability through the courts.

## Claims, Denials, and Political Narratives

From the outset, the cooperative fraud case involving Rabi Lamichhane
has been heavily politicized, with divergent narratives from Lamichhane
and his supporters on one side and opposition leaders and critics on the
other. Below is an overview of the major claims, denials, and framing of
the issue by different actors:

### Lamichhane's and Rastriya Swatantra Party's Position

**Rabi Lamichhane has consistently denied any intentional wrongdoing**
in relation to the cooperative funds. His core defense is that he
**never knowingly or directly diverted cooperative money** -- instead,
he claims that if such funds ended up in Gorkha Media's accounts, it was
without his active involvement or knowledge. Key points of his narrative
include:

- **No Direct Evidence of My Hand in Transfers:** Lamichhane seizes on
  the fact that the inquiry committee did not find a document with his
  signature authorizing cooperative withdrawals. In Parliament, after
  the report, he and RSP leaders publicly **claimed the report actually
  *"acquitted"* him of direct
  embezzlement**[\[136\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=RSP%20chair%20Lamichhane%20and%20Vice,had%20exonerated%20the%20party%20chair%E2%80%9D).
  Lamichhane and RSP Vice-chair **Swarnim Wagle** told reporters that
  because the committee couldn't "directly link" him to the routing of
  funds (i.e., no smoking gun of him ordering the transfer), it proved
  accusations
  false[\[136\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=RSP%20chair%20Lamichhane%20and%20Vice,had%20exonerated%20the%20party%20chair%E2%80%9D).
  RSP noted that even their member on the committee did not dissent,
  implying the report was fair and had effectively cleared Lamichhane of
  personal
  culpability[\[136\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=RSP%20chair%20Lamichhane%20and%20Vice,had%20exonerated%20the%20party%20chair%E2%80%9D).
  They welcomed the report as vindication that Rabi did not himself
  steal money; rather, at worst, the company did.

- **Acknowledgment of Funds but Distancing from Responsibility:** The
  RSP stance has been a nuanced one -- they **acknowledge that Gorkha
  Media Network did receive cooperative funds** and that this was wrong
  (they haven't disputed the fact of
  diversion)[\[137\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=diverting%20cooperative%20funds%20to%20the,the%20report%20confirms%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added).
  However, they argue this was a corporate matter, not a personal crime
  by Lamichhane. Acting RSP spokesperson **Manish Jha** pointed out that
  RSP had *"acknowledged that Gorkha Media Network had diverted the
  cooperative funds for its operation"* and that the report simply
  confirmed
  this[\[20\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Manish%20Jha%2C%20acting%20spokesperson%20of,the%20report%20confirms%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added).
  Their spin is that Rabi's opponents alleged he *personally embezzled*
  money, which RSP says was disproven since the money trail goes to the
  company and not a personal vault. They emphasize that Lamichhane was
  not caught signing any cheques to take money out of cooperatives --
  instead, cooperative officials did that (hence Rabi's argument that
  **liability lies with those officials and the company**, not him
  individually).

- **"Political Vendetta" Narrative:** Lamichhane has strongly implied
  that the entire case is a **conspiracy by rival political forces** to
  tarnish him because of his rapid political rise and anti-establishment
  stance. In his dramatic **18-page appeal from custody (Bhairahawa
  Jail)**, he outlines this
  theory[\[138\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Now%20let%20me%20get%20to,Why%20did%20you%20attempt%20to)[\[139\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=waited%20until%20midnight%20for%20my,especially%20leaders%20of%20the%20Nepali).
  He writes that after RSP's electoral success and his refusal to play
  power games (e.g., he claims he *"declined the offer to become Prime
  Minister"* which made traditional leaders fear him), the old parties
  sought to "finish" him by branding him a 'cooperative
  fraud'[\[140\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=respond%20that%20Rabi%20Lamichhane%20was,Prime%20Minister%E2%80%99s%20offer%20truly%20be).
  Lamichhane specifically accuses **Nepali Congress leaders (like Sher
  Bahadur Deuba and Gagan Thapa)** and even a faction of CPN-UML of
  colluding to frame
  him[\[141\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=landscape%20and%20led%20to%20a,My%20only%20demand%20was)[\[142\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=to%20accept%20the%20post,a%20shift%20in%20public%20consciousness).
  He notes the timing: allegedly, the day after he refused to help NC
  form a government in 2023, the NC started calling him a cooperative
  fraud[\[139\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=waited%20until%20midnight%20for%20my,especially%20leaders%20of%20the%20Nepali).
  He also cites that he, as Home Minister, had taken actions against
  corruption (e.g., arresting a fugitive banker, which "unnerved" some
  leaders) and thus made
  enemies[\[143\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Now%20let%20me%20get%20to,Balkot%3F%20Why%20did%20you%20attempt).
  In short, his narrative is that he is a **victim of a political
  witch-hunt**, where genuine cooperative scammers have roped his name
  in to defame him and halt his political momentum.

- **Claims of Upholding Rule of Law:** Lamichhane portrays himself as
  someone who actually wanted accountability in the cooperative sector.
  He astonishingly claims that he *"personally took the initiative"* to
  convince the coalition to form the parliamentary probe committee,
  despite PM Prachanda and KP Oli being
  reluctant[\[23\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=March%206%2C%202024%2C%20the%20then,committee%20regarding%20alleged%20misappropriation%20in).
  By this telling, he had nothing to hide and welcomed an investigation,
  expecting to be exonerated. (Critics find this hard to believe, since
  RSP and UML initially opposed the committee formation until pressured
  by
  NC[\[26\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=The%20task%20force%20has%20not,holding%20three%20rounds%20of%20discussion).)
  Nonetheless, Rabi tries to flip the script by saying he championed the
  probe to show transparency. He also asserts that during his brief
  tenure as Home Minister, he **enforced the law impartially**
  (mentioning he didn't spare even the powerful, which is why he raided
  someone in "Balkot" -- an allusion to UML chairman Oli's residence --
  though that's a separate
  context)[\[144\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=who%20brought%20Bechan%20Jha%20out,Deuba%20and%20leader%20Arzu%20Rana).
  This is meant to bolster his credibility that he's anti-corruption,
  not a perpetrator.

- **Technical/Legal Defense:** On legal grounds, Lamichhane argues that
  even if cooperative money entered Gorkha Media, the charges against
  him are **misplaced under the law**. In his writings he notes: the
  committee report said to hold him accountable *"as per prevailing
  laws"* if he was involved in spending the cooperative-sourced
  money[\[40\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Respected%20Fathers%20and%20Mothers%2C%20Now%2C,5).
  He interprets this to mean the **Company Act or Civil Code** for any
  misuse of company funds, not the Cooperative Act or Organised Crime
  Act[\[40\]](https://api.rspnepal.org/downloads/c40087a4-af7a-4de5-bd65-cc539a6b5462/download#:~:text=Respected%20Fathers%20and%20Mothers%2C%20Now%2C,5).
  By charging him under the latter, he claims the state is overreaching
  and misusing legal provisions. Essentially, he says: I was a media MD,
  not a cooperative official; if the company misused funds, that's a
  corporate issue, not cooperative fraud on his part. This is a more
  nuanced defense likely to come up in court: whether Lamichhane can be
  treated as if he were an official of those cooperatives (the
  prosecution theory) or if he's only culpable for how the company
  handled money.

- **Denial of Personal Gain and Knowledge:** Lamichhane told
  investigators that he *"had no knowledge of the money transferred to
  his or the company's bank accounts from the
  cooperative"*[\[88\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=from%20the%20Suryadarshan%20Cooperative%20to,he%20was%20the%20managing%20director).
  He maintains that GB Rai and others handled the finances, and if money
  came in, he wasn't aware it was from depositor funds. He also says he
  didn't **personally profit** beyond his 15% sweat equity -- meaning he
  drew no dividend or windfall; in fact, Galaxy 4K failed, so he
  insinuates he didn't get rich from this, and thus had no motive to
  defraud. (However, the counter is he gained a TV station run on
  others' money and political capital from that exposure.) Lamichhane
  also points out that when the cooperatives invested, it wasn't him
  begging for money -- those cooperatives were themselves mismanaged and
  he got caught in the crossfire.

- **Public Sentiment and Support:** Rabi's supporters, including many
  RSP cadres and fans of his TV persona, echo that he is being
  **targeted because he upset the old political order**. On social media
  and rallies, they question why other cooperative scammers from big
  parties haven't been jailed, implying selective enforcement. Some cite
  that cooperatives scams had been rampant for years with few
  high-profile arrests until Lamichhane, hinting that it's too
  coincidental that the one outsider politician got nabbed. They also
  emphasize his philanthropic image from TV days and suggest he's
  incapable of such fraud. RSP at times contrasted his case to bigger
  corruption cases (like contemporaneous scandals) that didn't see
  arrests, framing Rabi as being singled out for being an "easy target"
  or to neutralize RSP's challenge in politics.

### Opposition Leaders and Other Parties' Narrative

On the other side, leaders from Nepali Congress, RPP, Maoist Centre, and
even some from UML have framed the issue as one of **holding a prominent
figure accountable for genuine wrongdoing**. They reject the persecution
narrative and insist the facts speak for themselves. Key points from
this perspective:

- **Lamichhane Directly Involved in Fraud:** Leaders like **Gagan Thapa
  (NC)** accused Lamichhane of being directly complicit, not just an
  unwitting beneficiary. Gagan Thapa publicly alleged that Lamichhane
  had *"diverted cooperative funds to the media company using his own
  signature."*[\[145\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=Secretary%20Gagan%20Thapa%20had%20claimed,funds%20for%20its%20operation%2C%20which)
  In other words, he claims Lamichhane signed documents (perhaps cheques
  or agreements) to take money from cooperatives. Although RSP says this
  was disproven, the opposition maintains that the evidence of
  Lamichhane's cheques from Gorkha Media to cooperatives and
  back[\[27\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=Kaski%20police%20claimed%20that%20Lamichhane,he%20disassociated%20from%20the%20company),
  as well as deposit slips in his
  name[\[121\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20cooperative%E2%80%99s%20own,service%20charges%20from%20this%20deposit),
  *is* direct evidence of involvement. They argue that such transactions
  could not have happened without Lamichhane's active consent, given his
  position. The opposition often highlights the Rs 20 million deposit to
  Lamichhane's account -- asking why an honest person would accept such
  a huge sum from a cooperative if he didn't know what it
  was[\[119\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/430090/#:~:text=Of%20this%20amount%2C%20Rs%2020,been%20transferred%20under%20questionable%20circumstances).

- **Equal Application of Law, Not Political:** The establishment parties
  contend that prosecuting Lamichhane is a matter of principle -- **no
  one is above the law, no matter how popular**. NC in particular took
  up the cause of cooperative victims; General Secretary **Bishwa
  Prakash Sharma** and others joined protests alongside victims,
  projecting themselves as protectors of the people's money. They argue
  that if Lamichhane were spared due to his political clout, it would
  set a terrible precedent. RPP's **Dhruba Pradhan** explicitly stated
  that Lamichhane must face legal consequences because *"our law does
  not permit the rerouting of cooperative funds to a private company,
  yet Lamichhane and the company did exactly that"*, emphasizing that
  not being caught red-handed doesn't absolve
  him[\[33\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20not%20being,Nepal%20Police%2C%20told%20the%20Post).
  The opposition frequently invokes examples of past cooperative scams
  (like the big "Oriental Cooperative" scandal a decade ago) where
  political protection let culprits off; they vow not to let that happen
  in this case.

- **Criticism of RSP's Spin:** Other parties were quick to refute RSP's
  celebratory interpretation of the parliamentary report. When RSP
  leaders claimed the report exonerated Rabi, members of the committee
  from NC, UML, RPP immediately clarified to media that **Lamichhane was
  indeed found
  culpable**[\[146\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=But%20committee%20members%20don%E2%80%99t%20agree,lawmaker%20and%20committee%20member).
  They pointed out that the report clearly recommended prosecuting
  him[\[91\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=It%20states%20that%20the%20bank,Ramtel%20is%20in%20judicial%20custody).
  Even UML's chair of the committee, Surya Thapa, although from a party
  allied with RSP at the time, did not dispute the findings against
  Lamichhane. This bipartisan concurrence undercut RSP's narrative.
  **Ishwari Neupane (NC)** said plainly that cooperative money was
  invested in Gorkha Media under Lamichhane's
  watch[\[32\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDuring%20our%20investigation%2C%20we%20found,%E2%80%9D).
  **Lekhnath Dahal (Maoist)** highlighted the falsehoods in Lamichhane's
  share
  dealings[\[34\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/17/lamichhane-guilty-of-cooperatives-funds-misuse-forgery-probe#:~:text=he%20said%20he%20sold%20after,those%20claims%20to%20be%20false).
  Such statements sought to make it clear that RSP was trying to spin
  the outcome, but the reality was damning.

- **Political Motives Acknowledged but Justified:** Some leaders
  privately admit that, of course, NC saw a political advantage in
  pressing this issue -- it put a rival in the dock. However, they argue
  that **political motivation and genuine accountability can coincide**.
  Nepali Congress was indeed eager to check RSP's rise, but they chose a
  legitimate issue (victims of cooperative fraud are a real
  constituency) to do so. As one NC member put it, "We didn't
  manufacture the allegations; depositors came to us crying for help."
  For NC, pursuing Lamichhane also helped them reclaim the
  anti-corruption mantle that RSP had tried to take. **Home Minister
  Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Maoist)** at one point commented that the law
  will take its course and that RSP should not politicize a legal case.
  The governing parties (post-RSP's exit from government) insisted that
  police and prosecutors were acting independently, not on orders from
  NC or anyone.

- **Sympathy for Victims as the Prime Narrative:** All parties across
  the spectrum publicly framed their actions as being **on behalf of the
  cheated cooperative depositors**. NC leaders like **Dila Sangraula**
  spoke about returning people's savings and hitting the streets for
  justice[\[147\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/163119#:~:text=According%20to%20NC%20central%20member,of%20cooperatives%20from%20the%20streets).
  Even UML and Maoist MPs who initially dragged feet on the committee
  had to fall in line with the narrative that Parliament must address
  people's suffering. This broad consensus on victims' rights made it
  difficult for RSP to sell the story that this was only about cornering
  Lamichhane. The media frequently showed images of elderly and
  middle-class Nepalis who lost their deposits, which built moral
  pressure. Thus, the political narrative from the establishment was:
  *"This is not about Rabi versus us; it's about righting a wrong done
  to thousands of citizens. If Rabi is innocent, he can prove it in
  court, but the process must happen."*

- **Impact on RSP and Internal Politics:** Rivals also speculated that
  RSP internally might suffer due to Lamichhane's troubles. Some pointed
  out that other RSP MPs (like **Shishir Khanal** or **Swarnim Wagle**)
  did not vocally protest his arrest beyond a point, suggesting cracks
  in RSP's unity or maybe an understanding that the case had merit.
  There was chatter in political circles that if Lamichhane were
  convicted and jailed long-term, RSP might implode or new leadership
  would emerge. This wasn't overtly said in public by other party
  leaders, but it influenced how far RSP could push its narrative. They
  knew others were watching if RSP would resort to mass protests or
  resignations -- which it did not, arguably because the evidence
  against Rabi made that politically risky. In fact, in contrast to NC
  obstructing parliament to form the committee, **RSP did not obstruct
  parliament to defend Rabi**; they mostly fought in court. This dynamic
  showed that even Rabi's party understood the optics: defending him too
  aggressively could look like excusing financial crime.

- **Media and Civil Society:** Nepal's independent media by and large
  echoed the need for accountability. Major outlets like
  *Kantipur/Kathmandu Post, Nagarik/MyRepublica, OnlineKhabar* etc., ran
  investigative pieces and editorials supportive of the victims and
  probing of Lamichhane's explanations. For instance, editorials
  questioned how a politician who ran on an anti-corruption platform
  ended up entangled in such a scandal, and they implored the courts to
  set a precedent that powerful people can't embezzle with impunity.
  Civil society organizations (like Transparency International Nepal)
  welcomed the inquiry committee and urged swift prosecution. This
  created a narrative environment where RSP's cries of political
  vendetta found some traction among Rabi's fanbase, but did not become
  the dominant story in mainstream discourse. Instead, the **dominant
  narrative was that of a financial crime being addressed**.

In summary, **Lamichhane and RSP's narrative** is one of denial and
victimhood -- insisting he did nothing illegal and is being framed by
fearful political rivals -- whereas the **opposing narrative** centers
on factual culpability and justice for ordinary people. Lamichhane's
team highlights lack of direct proof and political conspiracy, while
opponents highlight the money trail and principle of law. This clash of
narratives continues to play out in the media and public opinion.
Notably, after his release on bail in Dec 2025, Lamichhane held press
meetings reiterating his innocence and vowing to fight the charges;
meanwhile, NC and others cautiously stated they trust the courts to
deliver justice. The truth of the matter now largely rests on legal
adjudication rather than public relations, but these narratives have
shaped public perception and could influence the political repercussions
for Lamichhane and his party.

## Current Status and Open Questions

**Current Status (as of late 2025):** Rabi Lamichhane is now **out on
bail** in all the cases filed against him, following the High Court's
order on December 18, 2025 to release him upon a Rs 27.48 million
bond[\[83\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=A%20division%20bench%20comprising%20Chief,after%20furnishing%20the%20required%20amount).
He had earlier secured bail in the Kaski, Kathmandu, and Chitwan cases,
and the December High Court decision secured his release in the
Rupandehi (Supreme Cooperative) case as
well[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/06/chitwan-court-orders-rabi-lamichhane-s-release-on-rs5-4-million-bail-in-cooperative-fraud-case#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20Lamichhane%E2%80%99s%20first,based%20Supreme%20Cooperative)[\[5\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=The%20Butwal%20bench%20of%20the,fraud%20and%20organised%20crime%20case).
Thus, Lamichhane is no longer in custody, though he remains charged with
serious offences and the trials are pending. He is still **suspended
from his Parliament seat** due to the money-laundering charges -- that
suspension will last until either he is cleared or his term
ends[\[84\]](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepal-court-grants-bail-to-home-minister-lamichhane-in-cooperative-scam-case/#:~:text=allegedly%20originating%20from%20Surya%20Darshan,to%20be%20of%20illicit%20origin).
Legally, he must attend court dates in multiple districts as the
proceedings progress. No verdicts have been reached yet; the cases are
likely in the evidence examination or witness deposition stages in the
various district courts. The Supreme Court of Nepal has also intervened
administratively -- for instance, it directed the Rupandehi District
Court to **digitize and upload all documents related to the Supreme
Cooperative fraud
case**[\[148\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-orders-digital-record-of-rabi-lamichhanes-cooperative-fraud-case-70-53.html#:~:text=SC%20orders%20digital%20record%20of,the%20Supreme%20Cooperative%20fraud%20case),
an unusual step reflecting the high public interest and to ensure
transparency (perhaps in light of some court documents being vandalized
during unrelated protests). Politically, Lamichhane has resumed some
public activities as RSP chairman, but with a more cautious tone. His
party is in opposition and has not splintered, standing by him (albeit
without obstructing the legal process). The cooperative victims across
various districts are still awaiting restitution -- many have yet to get
their money back. The government has been working on property seizures:
e.g., freezing Gorkha Media's assets and those of cooperative operators,
with the intent to eventually compensate depositors. However, progress
on payouts is slow, and victims continue to protest sporadically, though
with the hope that a successful prosecution of Lamichhane and others
might lead to recovery of funds. The government's promised reforms
(deposit security fund, etc.) are in motion but not fully realized.

In this fluid situation, several **open questions** remain unanswered:

- **Will Rabi Lamichhane be convicted?** -- The biggest question looming
  is the outcome of the trials. The prosecution believes it has strong
  evidence (documents, banking records, witness testimonies from co-op
  staff) tying Lamichhane to the illegal fund flows. Lamichhane's
  defense will likely argue lack of direct intent or knowledge. The
  courts will have to decide if the evidence meets the burden of proof
  for fraud, money laundering, etc. Convictions could result in lengthy
  prison sentences (potentially over a decade, given multiple laws) and
  fines[\[128\]](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/23/kaski-attorney-seeks-up-to-15-years-jail-for-rabi-lamichhane#:~:text=laundering%20charges),
  which would end Lamichhane's political career and possibly send a
  powerful message about accountability. An acquittal, on the other
  hand, would be politically explosive -- Lamichhane would claim
  complete vindication and it could boost his outsider narrative.
  Intermediate outcomes are also possible (e.g., convicted on some
  charges, acquitted on others). The timeline for verdicts is uncertain;
  each district case might conclude separately unless they are somehow
  consolidated or sequentially resolved.

- **What will happen to the** misappropriated funds **and the**
  victims**? -- Even if Lamichhane and others are convicted, the
  practical matter of recovering the lost money is complex. Cooperative
  depositors are asking: *When do we get our money back?* Till now,
  progress has been minimal -- media reports say** no substantial
  progress in returning depositors' money had occurred by
  mid-2025**[\[149\]](https://theannapurnaexpress.com/story/51148/#:~:text=No%20progress%20in%20returning%20coop,Savings%20and%20Credit%20Cooperatives).
  The government might have to auction Gorkha Media's remaining assets
  (if any -- it might just have equipment/debts) and the personal
  properties of the accused. Gitendra Rai, for instance, allegedly
  absconded with a lot of money; if he isn't caught, recovery is
  tougher. The** Rs 27.4 million bail amount **Lamichhane deposited will
  remain with the court as security -- potentially to be applied toward
  any restitution if he's found
  guilty[\[83\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/12/18/tulsipur-high-court-orders-release-of-rabi-lamichhane-on-bail#:~:text=A%20division%20bench%20comprising%20Chief,after%20furnishing%20the%20required%20amount).
  Similarly, other bail amounts from co-accused could offset some
  losses. But the total scam is in billions, far above what has been
  secured. The government's reform plan (security fund) might need
  significant state financing to make victims whole, raising questions
  of fairness (public funds to pay for private fraud?). Additionally,
  about** Rs 49 billion\*\* in deposits were embezzled across various
  cooperative scams nationally, according to one investigative
  report[\[150\]](https://www.cijnepal.org/cooperative-fraud#:~:text=Cooperative%20fraud%3A%20Will%20the%20Rs,scam%20that%20took%20root).
  Solving one case is just a dent in that crisis.

- **Legal Precedent and Further Charges:** The case could set precedents
  in Nepali law. For example, if Lamichhane is prosecuted as a
  *non-official who benefited from cooperative fraud*, it will clarify
  the reach of the Cooperative Act -- can it punish someone who wasn't
  formally part of a cooperative's management? Also, will the courts
  treat the layering of transactions as a clear case of money
  laundering? Another open matter is whether any *additional charges or
  defendants* will emerge. The parliamentary probe named four
  individuals, but police have charged dozens; will any political or
  regulatory figures who enabled the fraud be charged? (e.g., if
  evidence showed any politician or bureaucrat turned a blind eye or
  helped approve illegal investments, they could be implicated. So far,
  none besides Lamichhane, who was both politician and beneficiary, have
  been named.) There was talk of investigating some **regulators in the
  Cooperative Department** for negligence -- no news yet, but it remains
  a question if accountability will extend to systemic enablers.

- **Status of Gitendra "GB" Rai and other fugitives:** GB Rai remains at
  large abroad. An **Interpol notice** is out, but will Nepal be able to
  extradite him? Rai likely holds a lot of answers (and possibly money).
  If he's never brought to trial, a chunk of accountability is missing.
  Similarly, if any cooperative funds were stashed overseas or converted
  to other assets (real estate, etc.), recovering those will be
  challenging. Open question if Nepal will enlist foreign assistance for
  asset tracing related to this case.

- **Political Future of Rabi Lamichhane and RSP:** While technically
  separate from the legal judgment, the case's resolution will heavily
  influence Lamichhane's political trajectory. Open questions include:
  Can Lamichhane contest the next election (due in a few years) if the
  case is unresolved or if he's convicted? Nepali law bars convicted
  individuals of moral turpitude crimes from office for some time. If
  he's acquitted or lightly penalized, will he leverage that to bounce
  back as an anti-corruption crusader (claiming he was targetted
  unjustly)? Or has the damage to his image been done irreparably among
  the public? RSP's performance in future elections may answer this; the
  party did lose some momentum after 2024, but local polls will test if
  Rabi's base stays loyal. Internally, will any RSP leaders challenge
  Lamichhane's leadership given the stigma now attached? So far, the
  party has stood by him, but prolonged legal troubles could cause rifts
  as others eye the top position.

- **Reforms Implementation:** An open question is whether the promised
  **cooperative sector reforms** will actually be implemented and be
  effective. Creating a deposit insurance fund, stricter auditing, and a
  dedicated tribunal could greatly improve accountability in the future.
  Will Parliament amend the Cooperative Act to increase oversight? The
  case has shown light on loopholes: cooperatives operating like banks
  without sufficient regulation. Observers are watching if the
  government enacts the Cooperatives Crisis Management recommendations.
  The durability of the political will to reform (once the headlines
  fade) is uncertain.

- **Public Trust Restoration:** Finally, beyond the specifics of this
  case, a broader open question is: *Can public trust in cooperatives be
  restored?* Thousands of Nepalis trusted these institutions as
  community banks. The Lamichhane case, being so high-profile,
  underscored the betrayal of that trust. The government's response,
  including prosecuting someone as prominent as Lamichhane, may somewhat
  assure people that action is taken. However, unless money is recovered
  and systemic fixes put in place, many might remain wary of
  cooperatives. It's an ongoing challenge for Nepal's financial
  inclusion efforts.

In conclusion, the cooperative fraud case involving Rabi Lamichhane is
at a **critical juncture**. Accountability processes have moved from
investigation to prosecution, and a political narrative war has subsided
into a wait for judicial outcomes. Lamichhane's release on bail provides
him breathing space, but the shadow of the trial will follow him. The
coming months (or years) will likely see courtrooms in Pokhara, Butwal,
Chitwan, Kathmandu, and Birgunj meticulously examining evidence. The
outcome will not only determine the fate of an individual politician but
also stand as a referendum on Nepal's ability to uphold the rule of law
against high-level malfeasance. Stakeholders -- from cheated depositors
to political parties -- are anxiously awaiting those resolutions while
continuing to push for broader reforms to ensure that **"Jawafdehi"
(accountability)** in such cases is the new norm rather than a one-off
exception.
