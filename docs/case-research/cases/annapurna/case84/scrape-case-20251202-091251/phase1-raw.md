**4. Description of Events**

<p>The "One Billion Dollar Scandal" of 1984 centered on a proposal brought by Indian nationals, primarily P.G. Desai and Vijay Desai, to the Panchayat-era government of Nepal. The proposers claimed that Nepal could secure a long-term loan of one billion US dollars at an interest rate far below the international standard. The plan, supported by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Finance Minister Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani, was to leverage this loan, with the government anticipating a profit of around 42 crore Nepali rupees from the interest rate spread.</p>
<p>The deal met with internal resistance from Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). Governor Kalyan Bikram Adhikari tasked Mukunda Prasad Ghimire, the head of the Foreign Exchange Department, with vetting the proposal. Ghimire's investigation revealed the proposers were fraudulent, and he concluded the scheme was a sham that could have cost the nation between 40 to 50 million US dollars. After P.G. Desai's offer was rebuffed by the governor, Desai allegedly offered 50% of his projected 70 crore rupee commission to anyone who could push the deal through. This led to the involvement of NRB's own Deputy Governor, Keshavnath Sharma, and a board member of Rastriya Banijya Bank, Indra Bikram Shah, who allegedly tried to "fix" the deal.</p>
<p>Governor Adhikari formally recommended the government reject the proposal. For his defiance, his term was not renewed, and he was effectively dismissed on December 8, 1984. Meanwhile, the story was leaked to Nepal's vibrant weekly newspapers. Publications like <em>Saptahik Bimarsha</em> and <em>Saptahik Manch</em> ran explosive articles, comparing the affair to the Watergate scandal and even publishing a leaked copy of the government's internal decision to proceed with the deal. This media exposure created immense public and political pressure. The scandal was debated fiercely in the Rashtriya Panchayat, forcing the government to ultimately scrap the deal. Mukunda Prasad Ghimire, the official who first exposed the rot, reportedly faced the government's wrath for his actions.</p>
