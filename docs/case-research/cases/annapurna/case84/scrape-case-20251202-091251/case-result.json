  "title": "Mr. Clean and Dollar Scandal (1984)",
  "description": "<p>The \"One Billion Dollar Scandal\" (एक अर्ब डलर काण्ड) of 1984 involved a fraudulent proposal to the Government of Nepal to acquire a <strong>one billion US dollar loan</strong>. The plan was presented by Indian nationals P.G. Desai and Vijay Desai to the government led by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, ironically known as 'Mr. Clean', and Finance Minister Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani.</p><p>The proposal suggested that Nepal could borrow the sum at a very low interest rate and profit from the interest rate differential, with a projected gain of around <strong>42 crore Nepali rupees</strong>. The government endorsed the deal, but it faced strong opposition from the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB).</p><p>Key events in the scandal include:</p><ul><li><strong>Internal Opposition:</strong> NRB Governor Kalyan Bikram Adhikari tasked Mukunda Prasad Ghimire, then head of the Foreign Exchange Department, to investigate the proposers. Ghimire's report concluded that P.G. Desai was a fraud and the scheme was a scam that could have cost Nepal <strong>US$ 40–50 million</strong>.</li><li><strong>Attempted Collusion:</strong> After being rejected by the Governor, P.G. Desai allegedly offered 50% of his projected 70 crore rupee commission to insiders who could push the deal through. This reportedly led to the involvement of NRB's Deputy Governor, Keshavnath Sharma, and a board member of Rastriya Banijya Bank, Indra Bikram Shah.</li><li><strong>Retaliation:</strong> For his steadfast opposition, Governor Adhikari's term was not renewed, and he was effectively dismissed on December 8, 1984.</li><li><strong>Media Exposure:</strong> The secret deal was leaked to weekly newspapers, notably <em>Saptahik Bimarsha</em> and <em>Saptahik Manch</em>. <em>Saptahik Bimarsha</em> published a photocopy of the government's decision, sparking a massive political and public outcry.</li><li><strong>Political Fallout:</strong> The scandal was debated in the Rashtriya Panchayat (parliament), putting immense pressure on the Chand government. Faced with scrutiny, the government was ultimately forced to abandon the plan.</li></ul><p>The scandal is a prominent case of high-level corruption during the Panchayat era, thwarted by the integrity of a few public officials and the role of a free press.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While the core facts of the scandal are well-documented, some allegations and details remain uncorroborated and require further investigation:</p><ul><li><strong>Royal Involvement:</strong> A news report from Jana Aastha National Weekly alleges that the Indian proposers, P.G. Desai and Vijay Desai, approached the Nepal Rastra Bank in collaboration with the <strong>then-Prince Gyanendra Shah</strong>. This claim is not widely corroborated in other available sources.</li><li><strong>Identity of Proposer:</strong> One source, based on an interview, mentioned that an Indian actress named \"Meenakshi Anand\" brought the proposal, which contradicts the majority of sources that name the Desai brothers. This could be a misunderstanding or an unverified additional party.</li><li><strong>Background of the Desais:</strong> While multiple sources label the Desai brothers as \"frauds,\" specific details about their corporate identities or backgrounds in India are lacking.</li><li><strong>Parliamentary Records:</strong> Although it is documented that the scandal was debated in the Rashtriya Panchayat, specific official transcripts or committee reports from these sessions were not available in the sources reviewed and would require archival research.</li></ul>",
