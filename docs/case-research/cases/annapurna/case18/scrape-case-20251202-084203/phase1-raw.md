**Description:**
<p>The case revolves around the installation of a gold Jalahari, a receptacle at the base of the main Shivalinga, at the Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu. In January 2021, then Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli announced a government grant of NPR 300 million to replace the existing silver Jalahari with a gold one. The Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) proceeded with the project, which quickly became mired in controversy over allegations of financial irregularities, procedural flaws, and missing gold.</p>
<p>Initial complaints and a report by the Office of the Auditor General alleged that approximately 11 kg of gold, valued at around NPR 78.6 million, was unaccounted for during the process. This prompted an investigation by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The investigation involved temporarily removing the newly installed Jalahari on June 25, 2023, to measure its exact weight and test the quality of the gold under the protection of the Nepal Army.</p>
<p>Following its investigation, the CIAA concluded that there was a misappropriation of 1.491 kilograms of gold. On October 1, 2023, it filed a corruption case at the Special Court against three key officials, seeking to recover Rs 11.7 million (1.17 Crore). However, on April 30, 2024, a bench of the Special Court acquitted all accused individuals. The court ruled that the evidence did not substantiate claims of embezzlement or intentional misconduct, attributing the weight discrepancy to natural loss during the crafting process and the legal addition of other metals for durability. The verdict also criticized the CIAA for what it termed "selective prosecution."</p>
