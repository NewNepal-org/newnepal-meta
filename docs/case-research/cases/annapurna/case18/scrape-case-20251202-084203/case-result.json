  "title": "Pashupatinath Temple Gold Jalahari Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The case concerns allegations of corruption and financial irregularities during the installation of a gold Jalahari (a base covering the Shivalinga) at the Pashupatinath Temple in 2021. The project was initiated by then-Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli with a government grant of <strong>NPR 300 million</strong> to the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT).</p><p>Controversy arose following a report from the Office of the Auditor General which flagged that nearly 11 kg of gold was not properly accounted for. This prompted an investigation by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). On June 25, 2023, the CIAA temporarily removed the Jalahari to conduct a precise measurement of its weight and gold purity.</p><p>Following its investigation, the CIAA concluded that there was a misappropriation of <strong>1.491 kilograms of gold</strong>. On October 1, 2023, it filed a corruption case at the Special Court against three officials associated with PADT, seeking to recover <strong>NPR 11.7 million</strong>.</p><p>However, on April 30, 2024, the Special Court acquitted all three accused individuals. The court's verdict stated that the CIAA failed to prove its allegations, attributing the weight discrepancy to natural loss during the crafting process and the legal addition of other metals for structural integrity. The court also criticized the CIAA for engaging in what it termed 'selective prosecution'.</p>",
