  "description": "<p>The case concerns the extreme delay and subsequent contract termination for the expansion of the 16-kilometer Kamalbinayak-Nagarkot road in Bhaktapur. The project was awarded in <strong>June 2014</strong> to a joint venture of <strong>Shailung Construction Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, owned by Sharada Prasad Adhikari, and Indian firm AIPL (Aravali Infrapower Limited) Construction. Funded by a loan from the Exim Bank of India, the project had an initial contract value of approximately NPR 280 million (28 Crore) and a two-year completion deadline of mid-July 2016.</p><p>Over the next eight years, the project saw negligible progress, with the deadline being extended at least eight times. The road fell into a state of extreme disrepair, characterized by potholes, mud, and dust, posing severe health and safety hazards to residents and travelers. The dilapidated condition had a crippling effect on the local economy, particularly the tourism sector in Nagarkot, with entrepreneurs reporting a <strong>50% drop in tourist arrivals</strong>.</p><p>Public frustration led to numerous protests, including a unique campaign in November 2019 where locals posted photos of the contractor, Sharada Prasad Adhikari, on public vehicles and poles to shame the company into action. Allegations were consistently raised that Adhikari's political connections, notably being the landlord for former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', protected his firm from facing serious consequences like blacklisting despite its repeated failures.</p><p>Despite multiple warnings from government ministers and official notices, the work remained incomplete. Finally, on <strong>December 25, 2022</strong>, the Department of Roads terminated the contract with the Shailung-AIPL JV. In February 2023, the local Changunarayan Municipality initiated a new process to upgrade the road using its own resources.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p><ul><li>The total economic loss, including the impact on tourism, local businesses, and public health, is estimated to be far greater than the contract value but has not been formally quantified.</li><li>There were media reports of local accounts alleging that then-Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, when approached by locals, implied that the case was 'above him', suggesting high-level political protection for the contractor.</li><li>Shailung Construction's director, Ramesh Subedi, publicly claimed that the delays were primarily due to the government's failure to clear the project site (e.g., remove trees and poles) and were not a result of the company's negligence or political influence.</li></ul></p>",
