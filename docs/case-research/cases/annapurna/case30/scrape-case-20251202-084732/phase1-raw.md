### **Description**

<p>The project involved the expansion and upgrading of the approximately 16-kilometer road stretching from Kamalbinayak, Bhaktapur, to the major tourist destination of Nagarkot. The contract was awarded in <strong>June 2014</strong> to a joint venture of Shailung Construction, owned by Sharada Prasad Adhikari, and Indian company AIPL Construction. The project was funded through loan assistance from the Exim Bank of India.</p>

<p>With an initial two-year deadline, the road was supposed to be completed by <strong>mid-July 2016</strong>. However, the project was plagued by extreme delays, with the deadline being extended at least nine times over the next decade. By January 2018, four years into the project, only 40% of the work was complete. The prolonged failure to complete the road left it in a dilapidated state, with numerous potholes, creating hazardous conditions. It became muddy during monsoons and excessively dusty in the dry season, leading to significant hardship for locals, causing respiratory illnesses, and crippling the tourism industry. Tourism entrepreneurs in Nagarkot reported a <strong>50% decline in tourist arrivals</strong> due to the road's sorry state.</p>

<p>Numerous public protests were held over the years. In a notable form of protest in November 2019, locals began plastering images of contractor Sharada Prasad Adhikari on public vehicles, trees, and poles to shame the company into action. Local government officials also protested, with one ward chairman moving his office to the street to highlight the public's suffering.</p>

<p>There have been persistent allegations that Sharada Prasad Adhikari used his political connections to avoid serious repercussions. He is the landlord of Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', a major political leader and multiple-time Prime Minister, which critics claim protected his company from being blacklisted despite its consistent failure to perform.</p>

<p>Despite multiple warnings from various government ministers and officials over the years, including threats of contract termination, the project remained incomplete. Finally, in the last week of December 2024, the Road Improvement and Development Project Directorate canceled the contract. Following the termination, in February 2025, the Changunarayan Municipality initiated its own process to upgrade the road using internal resources, ahead of the "Nagarkot Visit Year 2082".</p>
