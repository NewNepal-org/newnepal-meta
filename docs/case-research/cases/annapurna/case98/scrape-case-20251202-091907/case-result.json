  "title": "Sudan APC Procurement Corruption Scandal",
  "description": "<p>The Sudan Scandal is a major corruption case in Nepal involving the embezzlement of funds during the procurement of Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and other logistical equipment for Nepal Police personnel serving in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan (UNAMID). The case implicated three former Inspectors General of Police (IGPs) and other high-ranking officials.</p><p>The core of the scandal was the procurement of obsolete, substandard, and overpriced equipment using funds from the Nepal Police Welfare Fund. An agreement was signed on September 27, 2007, with UK-based supplier <strong>Assured Risk Private Limited</strong> and its Nepali agent, <strong>Bhagwati Traders</strong>. The purchased equipment, including eight APCs, was later found to be old, non-operational, and merely painted to look new. Consequently, the United Nations inspection team in Darfur rejected the equipment, deeming it unfit for use. This not only resulted in a significant financial loss but also endangered the lives of Nepali peacekeepers who were left without adequate protection in a conflict zone.</p><p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) initiated a formal investigation and on May 24, 2011, filed a corruption case at the Special Court. The chargesheet alleged the embezzlement of <strong>NPR 288,161,629.30</strong>.</p><p>The legal process went through several stages:</p><ul><li>On February 13, 2012, the Special Court convicted the three former IGPs—Om Bikram Rana, Hem Bahadur Gurung, and Ramesh Chand Thakuri—along with the suppliers, but acquitted 31 other police officials.</li><li>On April 30, 2017, the Supreme Court of Nepal delivered a final verdict, upholding the conviction of the former IGPs and other police officials. However, it controversially overturned the Special Court's decision against the suppliers, acquitting Michael Rider of Assured Risk Ltd. and local agent Shambhu Bharati.</li></ul><p>The convicted officials, including the three former police chiefs, eventually surrendered and served prison sentences. The scandal severely damaged the reputation of Nepal Police and the country's standing in international peacekeeping circles.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There were significant allegations regarding political protection and involvement that were never formally pursued by the CIAA.</p><ul><li><strong>Political Leadership:</strong> The procurement decision was made during the tenure of Home Minister <strong>Krishna Prasad Sitaula</strong> and Home Secretary <strong>Umesh Mainali</strong>. A parliamentary committee report suggested that the political and administrative leadership could not be absolved of responsibility. However, Mr. Sitaula denied involvement, stating the procurement was managed directly by the Police Headquarters using its Welfare Fund, which did not require his ministry's endorsement. The CIAA was criticized for not pressing charges against any political figures.</li><li><strong>Origin of APCs:</strong> It was widely reported in the media that the Armoured Personnel Carriers were extremely old, with some sources claiming they were surplus from <strong>World War II</strong>. While their substandard nature was confirmed, their exact manufacturing date and service history remain unverified public information.</li></ul>",
