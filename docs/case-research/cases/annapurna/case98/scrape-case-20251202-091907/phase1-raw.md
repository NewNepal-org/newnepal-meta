Here are the raw findings regarding the "Sudan Scandal" (सुडानकाण्ड), based on the provided documents and further research.

### **Case Summary**

The Sudan Scandal is one of Nepal's most high-profile corruption cases, involving the embezzlement of funds during the procurement of Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and other logistical supplies for Nepal Police personnel deployed on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan. The case implicated three former Inspectors General of Police (IGPs) and numerous other high-ranking officials. The core of the scandal was the purchase of obsolete, substandard, and overpriced equipment, which were ultimately rejected by the UN, leading to significant financial loss and damage to Nepal's international reputation.

### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

*   **Nature of Corruption:** The scandal revolved around irregularities in the procurement of APCs and other logistical equipment for the Nepali Formed Police Unit (FPU) in Darfur. Allegations included procuring substandard, old, and non-operational equipment at inflated prices without following proper legal procedures. The equipment was purchased using money from the Nepal Police Welfare Fund.
*   **Financial Discrepancy:** The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a case on May 24, 2011 (2068 Jestha 24 BS), alleging that out of a total transaction of approximately Rs 445-450 million, around Rs 288-290 million was embezzled. A parliamentary State Affairs Committee (SAC) inquiry concluded that as much as Rs 310 million was misappropriated.
*   **Substandard Equipment:** The purchased APCs were found to be old, painted to look new, and not up to the standards required by the United Nations. A Home Ministry and Nepal Police investigation team sent to Darfur reported that the eight APCs were "sub-standard and useless" and were rejected by the UN inspection team. This left the Nepali peacekeepers operating in a dangerous environment without the necessary armoured protection. Some reports indicated the APCs were used during World War II.
*   **Suppliers:** The main supplier was a UK-based company, **Assured Risk Private Limited**, and its local agent in Nepal was **Shambhu Bharati**, proprietor of **Bhagwati Traders**.
*   **Political Involvement Allegations:** The procurement decision was made during the tenure of Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula of the Nepali Congress. A parliamentary committee report suggested that the political and administrative leadership at the Ministry of Home Affairs could not be immune from responsibility. However, Sitaula denied involvement, stating the procurement was handled by the Police Headquarters using the Police Welfare Fund and did not require his endorsement. The CIAA was criticized for not pressing charges against any political leaders.

### **Quotes and Specific Details**

*   A report from an investigation team sent to Sudan stated: "The UN´s inspection team in Sudan rejected the APCs sent by the Nepal Police."
*   Upon their conviction, the Special Court acquitted 31 police officers because it found them to be "working under chain of command pressure."
*   The CIAA's charge-sheet stated the accused officials and suppliers colluded in a manner that was a "breach of trust" and caused a loss of NPR 28,81,61,629.30 to the Police Welfare Fund.
*   The final verdict by the Supreme Court, delivered by a division bench of Chief Justice Sushila Karki and Justice Bishwambhar Shrestha, happened just hours before an impeachment motion was filed against CJ Karki by lawmakers from the ruling parties.

### **Impact and Aftermath**

*   **Reputational Damage:** The scandal severely tarnished the image of Nepal Police and the nation's reputation in international peacekeeping.
*   **Mission Closure:** The Nepal Police's Formed Police Unit (FPU) mission in Darfur, which began in September 2008, was eventually closed down. The UN Security Council decided to end the overall UNAMID mission effective December 31, 2020. The corruption scandal is cited as a key reason for the mission's notoriety and eventual closure.
