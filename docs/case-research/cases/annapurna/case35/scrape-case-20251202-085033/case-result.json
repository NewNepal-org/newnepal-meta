  "title": "Nepal Telecom 4G Expansion Project Irregularities",
  "description": "<p>The case involves allegations of significant financial irregularities, procedural flaws, and poor implementation in Nepal Telecom's (NTC) nationwide 4G network expansion project. The case unfolded in two major phases, both investigated by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Procurement Investigation (2018)</strong></p><p>Following the launch of 4G services in Kathmandu and Pokhara on January 1, 2017, NTC issued global tenders in late 2017 for a nationwide expansion. On January 21, 2018, a complaint was filed at the CIAA alleging irregularities in the tender process. The complaint highlighted that a bid from China Comservice International (CCSI) was only 25% below the estimated cost, which was considered suspiciously high. In February 2018, the <strong>CIAA began an investigation</strong>, seizing project files and halting the process for nine months. This delay drew criticism for hindering NTC's competitiveness. Amid the investigation, NTC's Managing Director, <strong>Kaminee Rajbhandari</strong>, was dismissed by the government on August 14, 2018, citing poor performance and project delays. In October 2018, the CIAA concluded its probe, directing the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) to proceed with the project while ensuring cost-effectiveness and quality.</p><p><strong>Phase 2: Contract Award and Quality Investigation (2019-2024)</strong></p><p>In early 2019, NTC awarded contracts worth approximately <strong>NPR 19 billion</strong>. China's ZTE Corporation was contracted for the core network, while Hong Kong's CCSI was awarded contracts for the radio access network. However, by June 2024, the project came under scrutiny again. The CIAA initiated a <strong>new investigation</strong> after findings indicated that the network's quality did not meet contractual agreements, leading to substantial losses. Key issues identified in this second probe include:</p><ul><li>A failure by contractors to install critical 'small cell' devices, essential for network speed and quality, valued at around <strong>NPR 1 billion</strong>.</li><li>The primary contractor, CCSI, had subcontracted work to Huawei for the installation of 6,000 small cell devices, but work worth approximately <strong>NPR 700 million (70 crore)</strong> was reportedly left incomplete.</li></ul><p>The 2024 investigation focuses on why the significant investment failed to yield the expected benefits for consumers and NTC, resulting in major financial losses and poor service quality.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following claims are from a single, uncorroborated news source (Nayapage) and require further verification:</p><ul><li>An allegation that the 4G project, which could have been completed for NPR 5 billion, was being awarded through a tender valued at NPR 32 billion, implying a potential scam of over <strong>NPR 20 billion</strong>.</li><li>The naming of <strong>Pradeep Thakur</strong> as a member of a tender evaluation committee allegedly complicit in the process.</li><li>Allegations of collusion between a former Minister and then-MD Kaminee Rajbhandari to award the contract to Huawei.</li></ul><p>Additionally, a 2024 report mentions that Kaminee Rajbhandari filed a complaint about embezzlement after her dismissal, which the CIAA later acquitted in November 2018, but primary documents for this are not available.</p>",
