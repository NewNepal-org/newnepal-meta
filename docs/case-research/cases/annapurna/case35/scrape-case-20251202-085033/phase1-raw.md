  "case_name": "Nepal Telecom 4G Expansion Project Irregularities",
  "status": "Under Investigation",
  "summary": "This case concerns allegations of significant financial irregularities, procedural flaws, and poor implementation in Nepal Telecom's (NTC) nationwide 4G network expansion project. The initial investigation, which began in 2018, focused on the procurement process and alleged overpricing in the tender evaluation. After a nine-month probe, the CIAA allowed the project to proceed. However, a new investigation was launched in 2024 focusing on the poor quality of the implemented network, with contractors failing to install key components as per the agreement, leading to substantial losses and underperformance of the service.",
  "description": "<p>The case revolves around Nepal Telecom's (NTC) project to expand its 4G/LTE services nationwide, following an initial launch in Kathmandu and Pokhara on January 1, 2017. [3, 4, 5] The expansion was quickly beset by allegations of corruption, leading to multiple investigations by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Procurement Investigation (2018)</strong></p><p>In late 2017, NTC issued global tenders for the expansion, including for the core network and BTS towers. [2] On January 21, 2018, a complaint was filed alleging irregularities in the tender process. [2] The complaint specifically highlighted that the bid from China Comservice International was only 25% below the estimated cost, whereas a 40-50% reduction was typical, suggesting procurement at an inflated price. [2]</p><p>Following this, the <strong>CIAA launched a formal investigation in February 2018</strong>, seizing all project-related files and halting the tender process. [1, 2, 5] This delay lasted approximately nine months and was heavily criticized by government officials, including the Minister for Information and Communications, for allowing NTC's competitor, Ncell, to expand its 4G coverage significantly while NTC was stalled. [1, 5] The Managing Director of NTC at the time, <strong>Kaminee Rajbhandari</strong>, was dismissed by the government on August 14, 2018, citing poor performance and the delays in 4G expansion. [1, 6] Rajbhandari contested her removal, calling it a politically motivated conspiracy. [6] In October/November 2018, the CIAA concluded its probe, directing the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) to proceed with the project while ensuring it was cost-effective and of good quality. [1, 3]</p><p><strong>Phase 2: Contract Award and Implementation Quality Investigation (2019-2024)</strong></p><p>Following the CIAA's directive, NTC awarded contracts worth approximately <strong>19 billion NPR</strong>. [4] The contracts for 'Network I' and 'Network II' were awarded to CCSI of Hong Kong, while China's ZTE Corporation was contracted to develop the core network. [3, 4]</p><p>However, by June 2024, the project was again under scrutiny. The CIAA initiated a <strong>new investigation</strong> after finding that the network's quality did not meet the contractual agreements. [4] Key issues identified in this second probe include:</p><ul><li>A failure to install critical 'small cell' devices, essential for network speed and quality, valued at around <strong>1 billion NPR</strong>. [4]</li><li>The primary contractor, CCSI, had subcontracted work to Huawei for the installation of 6,000 small cell devices, but work worth approximately <strong>70 crore NPR</strong> was left incomplete, leading to a deterioration in service. [4]</li><li>Overall, the investigation is examining why the significant investment of 19 billion NPR did not yield the expected benefits for consumers or the company, resulting in substantial losses. [4]</li></ul>",
