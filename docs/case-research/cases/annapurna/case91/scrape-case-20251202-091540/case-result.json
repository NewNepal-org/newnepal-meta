  "title": "Nepal Airlines Wide-Body Aircraft Purchase Corruption",
  "description": "<p>The case involves significant corruption and procedural irregularities in the 2017 procurement of two Airbus A330-200 wide-body aircraft by Nepal's national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC). The deal was valued at approximately <strong>$209.6 million</strong>, marking it as the largest procurement in Nepal's aviation history.</p><p>Key investigations, notably by a parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in 2018, revealed that NAC breached the Public Procurement Act. Instead of purchasing new aircraft directly from the manufacturer, Airbus, NAC procured used aircraft (with 1,000 flight hours) through a complex chain of intermediaries. This involved a US-based company, <strong>AAR Corp</strong>, which led a consortium that created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in Ireland named HiFly X Ireland Ltd to handle the transaction, a move that critics argued was designed to obscure transparency and inflate costs.</p><p>A central allegation was that NAC officials altered aircraft specifications post-bidding. The initial Request for Proposal (RFP) was for aircraft with a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 242 tonnes. However, NAC accepted planes with a lower MTOW of 230 tonnes without a corresponding price reduction. The PAC's report concluded this discrepancy alone led to massive financial losses, estimating the total irregularity at <strong>Rs 4.35 billion</strong>.</p><p>Following the PAC's recommendation, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched its own investigation. On April 4, 2024, the CIAA filed a formal corruption case at the Special Court against 32 individuals and two firms, claiming a lower but still substantial corruption amount of <strong>Rs 1.47 billion</strong> (approx. $13.39 million). The accused included former ministers, high-ranking bureaucrats, NAC officials, and foreign suppliers.</p><p>On December 5, 2024, the Special Court delivered its verdict, convicting key figures including former NAC Managing Director Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former Tourism Secretary Shankar Prasad Adhikari, and several foreign nationals representing the supplier companies. The court upheld the CIAA's claimed loss of Rs 1.47 billion and acquitted 21 individuals, including former Tourism Minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<ul><li>There were allegations of political bias in the Public Accounts Committee's investigation. Some lawmakers from the then-ruling party reportedly objected to the report's recommendations against the sitting aviation minister, Rabindra Adhikari (now deceased), while arguing it was lenient on previous ministers.</li><li>The Special Court, in its verdict, reportedly made a judicial note questioning why Prem Kumar Rai was not charge-sheeted by the CIAA. Rai was implicated in the PAC report as a secretary involved in the decision-making process and later became the Chief Commissioner of the CIAA itself.</li></ul>",
