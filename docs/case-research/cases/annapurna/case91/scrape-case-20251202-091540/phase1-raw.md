### **Case Details**

*   **`name`**: Nepal Airlines Wide-Body Aircraft Purchase Corruption
*   **`description`**:
    ```html
    <p>The case involves corruption and irregularities in the 2017 procurement of two Airbus A330-200 wide-body aircraft by Nepal's national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC). The deal, valued at $209.6 million, was the largest in Nepal's aviation history. [13]</p>
    <p>Investigations revealed multiple breaches of the Public Procurement Act. Instead of purchasing new aircraft directly from the manufacturer, Airbus, the NAC procured older planes (with 1,000 flight hours) through a complex chain of intermediaries, including a US-based company AAR Corp, which formed a consortium with German Aviation Capital of Germany and Hi Fly Trasporte Aereos of Portugal. [5, 8] This consortium created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in Ireland, HiFly X Ireland Ltd, to finalize the deal, obscuring transparency and inflating costs. [5, 6]</p>
    <p>A key allegation, highlighted by a parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report in 2018, was that NAC officials changed the aircraft specifications after the bidding process. [4] The initial request for proposal was for aircraft with a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 242 tonnes, but the NAC accepted aircraft with an MTOW of only 230 tonnes without a corresponding price reduction. [4, 6] The PAC concluded this discrepancy alone led to massive financial losses, estimating the total irregularity at <strong>Rs 4.35 billion</strong>. [4, 5, 8]</p>
    <p>Following the PAC's recommendation, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched its own investigation. On April 4, 2024, the CIAA filed a formal corruption case at the Special Court against 32 individuals (24 Nepalis and 8 foreigners) and two firms. [3, 10] The CIAA claimed a total corruption amount of <strong>Rs 1.47 billion</strong> (approximately $13.39 million), accusing officials of collusion with suppliers to embezzle funds. [3, 4, 6]</p>
    <p>In a related international development, Deepak Sharma, a British national and president of an AAR Corp subsidiary, pleaded guilty in a US court to conspiring to pay bribes to Nepali officials to secure the contract. [4]</p>
    <p>On December 5, 2024, the Special Court delivered its verdict, convicting key officials, including former NAC Managing Director Sugat Ratna Kansakar, and representatives of the foreign supplier companies. [7, 9] The court upheld the CIAA's claimed amount of Rs 1.47 billion in corruption. [9, 25]</p>

### **Unverified Information**

    <ul>
        <li>The initial document provided for this research mentioned a financial loss of <strong>$23.6 million</strong>. While parliamentary reports cited a loss of Rs 4.35 billion (~$40 million at the time) and the CIAA filed a case for Rs 1.47 billion (~$13.4 million), the specific origin of the $23.6 million figure is not clearly substantiated in the available public sources. It may have been an early estimate during the investigation.</li>
        <li>There were allegations of political bias in the PAC's investigation, with some lawmakers from the ruling party at the time objecting to the report's recommendations against the sitting aviation minister, Rabindra Adhikari (who is now deceased), while arguing it was lenient on previous ministers. [15, 18]</li>
        <li>The Special Court, in its verdict, reportedly made a judicial note questioning the role of Prem Kumar Rai, who was a secretary implicated in the PAC report but not charge-sheeted by the CIAA, where he later became Chief Commissioner. [19]</li>
