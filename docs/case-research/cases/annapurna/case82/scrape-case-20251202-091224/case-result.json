  "title": "Bhrikutimandap Land Lease Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The Bhrikutimandap Land Lease case, also known as the Fun Park Corruption Case, involves significant irregularities in the leasing of 60 ropani of public land belonging to the Social Welfare Council (SWC) in a prime area of Kathmandu. The land was leased to operate a fun park.</p><p>In September 2012, a decision led by the then Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare and SWC Chairperson, <strong>Badri Prasad Neupane</strong>, awarded a 15-year lease contract for the land to Kathmandu Fun Park. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) investigated the matter following complaints and uncovered major procedural and financial misconduct.</p><p>The key findings of the CIAA investigation were:</p><ul><li><strong>Procedural Violations:</strong> The contract was awarded directly without a competitive public tender process, which is a mandatory requirement under Nepal's public procurement laws for managing state assets.</li><li><strong>Gross Undervaluation:</strong> The land was leased for a monthly rent of NPR 555,000, amounting to approximately NPR 9,250 per ropani. The CIAA established that this rate was drastically below the market value, citing a nearby plot that was leased for NPR 78,571 per ropani, causing a substantial financial loss to the state.</li></ul><p>On February 4, 2019, the CIAA filed a corruption case at the Special Court against 14 individuals, including former Minister Neupane, SWC officials, and the park operators. The CIAA claimed a total loss of <strong>NPR 315,200,000</strong> to the state exchequer.</p><p>On February 28, 2023, the Special Court delivered its verdict, convicting nine of the accused. Badri Prasad Neupane was identified as the main perpetrator, while Nepali Congress lawmaker <strong>Tek Bahadur Gurung</strong>, an operator of the fun park, was convicted as an accomplice. The court acquitted five others. Sentences, including prison terms and hefty fines, were pronounced on March 9, 2023.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are some minor discrepancies across various news reports regarding the exact fine amounts for some individuals. For instance, one source reports that Rabindra Gurung was ordered to pay over NPR 2.43 crore, while another suggests the amount was NPR 1.21 crore in fine and the same in restitution. The primary amounts have been recorded in the main case file based on the most consistent reporting.</p>",
