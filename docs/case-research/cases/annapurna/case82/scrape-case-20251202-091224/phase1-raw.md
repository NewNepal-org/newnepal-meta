Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the Bhrikuti Mandap land lease case, based on the provided documents and available sources.

### Case Details

*   **Case Name:** Bhrikutimandap Land Lease Corruption Case
*   **Alias:** Fun Park Corruption Case
*   **Subject Matter:** Corruption and irregularities in the leasing of public land belonging to the Social Welfare Council (SWC) at Bhrikutimandap, Kathmandu.
*   **Alleged Loss:** NPR 315,200,000 (Thirty-one crore, fifty-two lakh rupees).

### Description

<p>The case revolves around a decision made in September 2012 by the Social Welfare Council (SWC), chaired by the then Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare, Badri Prasad Neupane. The council leased 60 ropani of land located in Bhrikutimandap, a prime area in Kathmandu, to run a "Fun Park".</p>
<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched an investigation following complaints of irregularities. The core allegations were:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Procedural Irregularities:</strong> The lease contract was awarded without adhering to the mandatory public procurement and tender process, which is a legal requirement for government contracts.</li>
    <li><strong>Gross Undervaluation:</strong> The land was leased for a monthly rent of NPR 555,000 (inclusive of taxes) for a 15-year term. This amounts to approximately NPR 9,250 per ropani per month. The CIAA highlighted that a nearby plot (Icchumati Vegetable Market) was leased for NPR 78,571 per ropani, demonstrating that the Fun Park land was leased at a rate significantly below the market value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following its investigation, the CIAA filed a corruption case on February 4, 2019 (21 Magh 2075 BS), against 14 individuals, including government officials and the leaseholders. The CIAA sought to recover NPR 315.2 million to cover the losses incurred by the state due to the undervalued contract.</p>
<p>On February 28, 2023, the Special Court, in a bench comprising Chairman Shree Kanta Paudel and members Shaligram Koirala and Balbhadra Bastola, convicted nine of the fourteen accused. Five individuals were acquitted. The court identified former Minister Badri Prasad Neupane as the main planner of the corruption scheme, while Tek Bahadur Gurung, a sitting Member of Parliament, was convicted as an accomplice.</p>

### Unverified Information

<p>The initial information provided for this research mentioned the year of the case as "2060" (Nepali calendar, approx. 2003-2004 AD). However, all credible sources found during the investigation point to the illegal lease agreement being signed in <strong>September 2012 (2069 BS)</strong>. The "2060" date appears to be incorrect information from the original document.</p>
