  "title": "Oxygen Plant Procurement Corruption (Federal and Municipal)",
  "description": "<p>A series of corruption and mismanagement cases related to the procurement of oxygen generation plants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal (circa 2020-2021). The most significant case involves the federal <strong>Department of Health Services (DoHS)</strong>, which allegedly colluded with the <strong>United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)</strong>, resulting in a loss of over <strong>NPR 3.34 Crore</strong> to the state.</p><p>The DoHS, instead of using its own procurement mechanisms, delegated the purchasing authority to UNOPS, a move allegedly designed to bypass government oversight and auditing procedures. The department transferred <strong>$4,517,378 USD</strong> from a World Bank loan to UNOPS for the procurement of oxygen plants and concentrators. Officials are accused of procuring the equipment at grossly inflated prices.</p><p>The term \"Oxygen Plant Scandal\" also covers other notable incidents:</p><ol><li><strong>Thaha Municipality, Makwanpur:</strong> The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against the municipality's then-Chief Administrative Officer, other officials, and a supplier for irregularities worth over <strong>NPR 1.1 Crore</strong>. The accused allegedly colluded to select a supplier who offered lower-quality technology at an inflated price. The case was filed at the Special Court in Kathmandu.</li><li><strong>Dhangadhi Sub-Metropolitan City:</strong> A <strong>NPR 1 Crore</strong> oxygen plant, funded by the Chaudhary Group and the sub-metropolis, was installed in a peripheral health center instead of the main Seti Provincial Hospital due to a political dispute. As a result, the plant remained unused for over two years, with its components left to rust.</li></ol>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The specific roles and identities of \"प्राविधिकहरू\" (technicians) in the larger federal procurement scandal involving UNOPS are not detailed in the available sources. It is plausible they were involved in creating technical specifications that favored certain suppliers, but this remains unconfirmed.</p><p>The current investigative or judicial status of the federal case against the Department of Health Services and UNOPS is not clear from public reports. Dr. Dipendraraman Singh, the then-Director-General of DoHS, has publicly denied the allegations of overpricing.</p>",
