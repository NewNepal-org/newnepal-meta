Here is the comprehensive research on the "Oxygen Plant Scandal."

***

### **Case Name:** Oxygen Plant Scandal (अक्सिजन काण्ड)

**Case Summary:**
The "Oxygen Plant Scandal" refers to significant irregularities and alleged corruption in the procurement of oxygen generation plants and related equipment in Nepal during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (circa 2020-2021 / 2077-2078 BS). While multiple separate incidents occurred at municipal and provincial levels, the most significant case, matching the reported loss figure, involves a federal-level procurement managed by the Department of Health Services in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), which resulted in an alleged loss of over 3 Crore NPR.

**Description:**
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide initiative was launched to install oxygen generation plants in hospitals across all seven provinces of Nepal. This was funded by a loan from the World Bank. However, the procurement process was marred by allegations of widespread corruption and mismanagement.</p>

<p>The primary case, with losses amounting to over 3 crore, involves the federal <strong>Department of Health Services</strong>. Instead of using its own procurement mechanisms, the Department delegated the purchasing authority for oxygen plants and concentrators to the <strong>United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)</strong>. This move was allegedly made to bypass standard government oversight and auditing procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Key Allegations in the Federal (UNOPS) Case:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inflated Costs and Collusion:</strong> Officials at the Department of Health Services and UNOPS are accused of colluding to procure equipment at grossly inflated prices. An article by Nagarik News alleges a total loss to the state of <strong>NPR 3,34,05,000</strong> (three crore, thirty-four lakh, five thousand).</li>
    <li><strong>Bypassing Oversight:</strong> The decision to use UNOPS for procurement was questioned, as the Department was capable of handling the purchase through a fast-track process itself. Critics claimed this was a deliberate move to avoid scrutiny, as UN agencies may not be subject to the same level of national auditing.</li>
    <li><strong>Irregular Fund Transfer:</strong> The Department of Health Services transferred <strong>$4,517,378 USD</strong> (equivalent to approximately 60 Crore NPR at the time) from a World Bank loan to UNOPS for the procurement. This transfer was authorized by the then-Director-General of the Department, Dr. Dipendraraman Singh, and the Director of the Management Division, Dr. Ramesh Kharel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other Related Incidents:</strong></p>
<p>The term "Oxygen Scandal" also encompasses other localized instances of corruption and mismanagement, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Thaha Municipality, Makwanpur:</strong> The CIAA filed a corruption case against the then-Chief Administrative Officer, engineers, and a supplier for irregularities worth <strong>NPR 1.1 Crore</strong> in the purchase of an oxygen plant. The officials were accused of selecting a supplier who proposed a lower-quality technology ('Refrigerated Air Dryer') instead of the specified 'Desiccant Air Dryer Technology' in collusion for financial gain. The case was filed at the Special Court.</li>
    <li><strong>Dhangadhi Sub-Metropolitan City, Sudurpashchim Province:</strong> A <strong>NPR 1 Crore</strong> oxygen plant, funded jointly by the Chaudhary Group (60 lakhs) and the sub-metropolis (40 lakhs), was installed in a peripheral health center instead of the main Seti Provincial Hospital where it was needed. This decision was reportedly due to a dispute between the then-mayor and the provincial government. As a result, the plant remained unused for over two years, with its components left to rust in an open field.</li>
</ol>

**Unverified Information:**
<p>The initial report mentioned "प्राविधिकहरू" (technicians) as being involved. While a biomedical engineer was formally charged in the Thaha Municipality case, the specific roles and identities of other technicians in the larger federal procurement scandal are not detailed in the available sources. It is plausible they were involved in creating technical specifications that favored certain suppliers, but this remains unconfirmed.</p>
<p>The exact trigger for the investigation into the federal/UNOPS case is not clear from the reports, nor is its current judicial or investigative status. Dr. Dipendraraman Singh, when questioned, denied the allegations of overpricing.</p>
