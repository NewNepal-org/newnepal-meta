### Description

<p>This case concerns allegations of corruption, illicit wealth acquisition, and money laundering against Cholendra Shumsher JB Rana, the former Chief Justice of Nepal. The investigations were formally initiated in late 2021 after multiple complaints were filed, most notably by medical reform activist Dr. Govinda KC on behalf of the 'Broad Citizens' Movement' and the Nepal Bar Association (NBA).</p>

<p>The core of the allegations is that Rana abused his position and authority to amass a significant fortune through corrupt activities. These activities allegedly include taking bribes in exchange for favorable verdicts, influencing judicial appointments, and using family members and intermediaries to manage illicit funds. The Nepal Bar Association submitted a 35-point memorandum to the parliamentary Impeachment Recommendation Committee detailing these accusations.</p>

<p>Two primary bodies have been investigating these claims: the <strong>Department of Money Laundering Investigation (DMLI)</strong> and a parliamentary <strong>Impeachment Recommendation Committee</strong>. The DMLI began its probe in December 2021, focusing on the assets of Rana's family and relatives due to legal constraints on directly investigating a sitting Chief Justice. Concurrently, Rana faced an impeachment motion filed by 98 lawmakers on February 13, 2022, which led to his suspension and a separate investigation by the parliamentary committee.</p>

<h4>Specific Allegations:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Illicit Property:</strong> Allegations claim Rana purchased two plots of land (kitta no. 109 and 110) in Thamel, Kathmandu, in his wife Reji Rana's name in 2065 BS (circa 2008-2009). This purchase was allegedly financed with crores of rupees embezzled during his tenure as a judge at the Special Court. The Nepal Bar also pointed to two ropani of land in Thamel registered in his wife's name and demanded an investigation into the source of income used for the purchase.</li>
    <li><strong>Use of Intermediaries:</strong> Rana is accused of using his brother, Prabhu Shumsher, to manage bribery operations from a rented office. Other individuals, including a Lalitpur trader known as 'Ghyu Sahu', Amit Shrestha, and Dipak Timilsina, have been named as alleged intermediaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Judicial Corruption:</strong> The NBA accused Rana of seeking bribes from candidates for High Court judge appointments and promotions. He was also accused of receiving a bribe from Krishna Bahadur Giri (aka Siddha Baba) and pressuring a lower court judge in that case.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Collusion:</strong> Rana was accused of compromising the principle of separation of powers by seeking a share in the government cabinet for his personal ambitions, a controversy that led to the appointment and subsequent swift resignation of Gajendra Hamal as a minister.</li>
</ul>
