### **Detailed Description of Allegations**

<p>The core of the allegation was that the accused colluded to embezzle state funds during a development project. The project involved the construction of a park and steps for a pond located near the Rani Health Post in Biratnagar Metropolitan City, Ward-15. The CIAA's investigation, prompted by a complaint, claimed to have found several irregularities.</p>

<p>According to the chargesheet filed by the CIAA:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Engineers and sub-engineers prepared a measurement book that falsely inflated the amount of work completed.</li>
    <li>Chief Administrative Officer Ekdev Adhikari approved this fraudulent measurement book without conducting on-site verification of the work's quality or quantity.</li>
    <li>The office-bearers of the user committee used this approved, false documentation to claim payment for the construction work.</li>
    <li>Payments were allegedly approved and disbursed for work that was never performed, and completed work was overvalued.</li>
    <li>Then Deputy Mayor Indira Karki was accused of clearing the measurement book despite being aware of the irregularities.</li>
    <li>The user committee violated regulations by using heavy machinery, such as an excavator, for a project that was supposed to be carried out using local labor to create employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CIAA filed the case under Section 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002, seeking to recover the embezzled funds and impose maximum punishment on the accused. The amount sought for recovery varied by individual:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>NPR 1,055,979.48</strong> from Ekdev Adhikari, Gopal Pokharel, Pushpak Pradhan, and Mohammad Iftekhar Alam.</li>
    <li><strong>NPR 1,055,979.48</strong> from the user committee officials: Baldev Sahu Sudi, Dinanath Acharya, and Kalpana Ghimire.</li>
    <li><strong>NPR 508,669.88</strong> from Indira Karki and Aslam Alam.</li>
</ul>
