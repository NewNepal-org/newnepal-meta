## Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project Corruption Allegations

**Case:** Allegations of Corruption and Irregularities in the Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project (UTKHEP)
**Case Number:** 93 (Internal Identifier)
**Status:** Complaint filed, under review/investigation by CIAA (unconfirmed status)

### Summary

A formal complaint was lodged at the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) in the Nepali year 2080 (2023/2024 AD) alleging massive corruption amounting to approximately NPR 51 billion in the 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project. The complaint, filed by an anti-corruption activist from Dolakha, targets former high-ranking officials of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) and the Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited (UTKHPL). The core allegation is that the project's budget intentionally and corruptly swelled from an initial estimate of NPR 35.29 billion to a final cost of over NPR 86 billion. While the complaint has been filed, there is no public record of the CIAA having filed a formal case in the Special Court.

Project officials and reports have attributed the significant cost and time overruns to legitimate factors, including the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Indian trade blockade, poor performance by a key contractor, and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Earlier, separate investigations into the project dating back to 2013-2014 also looked into allegations of using sub-standard construction materials.

### Key Details

*   **Entity Type:** Public Company (Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited)
*   **Sector:** Energy / Hydropower
*   **Location:** Lamabagar, Bigu Rural Municipality, Dolakha District, Bagmati Province, Nepal
*   **Alleged Offense:** Corruption, Embezzlement, Misuse of Authority, Illicit Enrichment
*   **Alleged Loss/Amount:** NPR 51 billion (approximately). This figure appears to represent the difference between the initial estimated project cost (NPR ~35 billion) and the final actual cost (NPR ~86 billion).

### Main Allegations and Findings

<div class='description'>
    <p>The primary allegations stem from a complaint filed at the CIAA by anti-corruption activist Bishwoniti Prakashman Pakhrin. The complaint is based on the UTKHPL's own annual report from the fiscal year 2076/77 (2019/2020 AD).</p>
    <p><strong>Key allegations include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive Cost Overrun:</strong> The complaint alleges that the project's cost was deliberately inflated from its initial estimate of <strong>NPR 35.29 billion</strong> (excluding interest) to a final cost of over <strong>NPR 86 billion</strong> through widespread irregularities and corruption among officials.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Capitalization:</strong> The estimated interest payment for the construction period ballooned from an expected <strong>NPR 13.22 billion</strong> to <strong>NPR 32 billion</strong> due to project delays, which the complaint implies were part of the corrupt activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Illicit Enrichment:</strong> The complainant has demanded a thorough investigation into the personal assets of the named officials and their relatives, including land, bank balances, and investments, suggesting they have been illicitly enriched.</li>
        <li><strong>Use of Substandard Materials:</strong> In earlier, separate complaints from 2013-2014, locals and the CIAA raised concerns over the use of low-quality construction materials. An 80-meter section of a project tunnel reportedly developed cracks, prompting the CIAA to send steel and cement samples for lab testing in India, which sources claimed were found to be substandard.</li>
        <li><strong>Embezzlement of Social Development Funds:</strong> A 2013 complaint by locals also alleged the embezzlement of millions of rupees that were meant for local development projects.</li>
    </ul>

### Unverified Information and Leads

<div class='unverified_info'>
    <p>The following information consists of allegations that have not been substantiated by official court filings or conclusive investigative reports, or details that remain unconfirmed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Status of CIAA Investigation:</strong> While it is confirmed that a complaint was filed in 2080 BS (2023/2024), it is <strong>unverified</strong> whether the CIAA has launched a formal, full-scale investigation based on it. There are no public press releases from the CIAA or records from the Special Court to confirm the case is proceeding.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Main Accused":</strong> The initial file for this case identifies a "मुख्य अभियुक्त" (Main Accused), but public documents do not single out one individual. The complaint filed at the CIAA names ten individuals for investigation. While Mukeshraj Kafle is listed first, his designation as the "main" accused is not formally established.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Proof of Corruption:</strong> The allegation of NPR 51 billion in corruption is primarily based on the large discrepancy between the initial estimated cost and the final project cost. While this is a significant red flag, there is no publicly available evidence (such as audit reports confirming fraud, bank transaction records, or whistleblower testimony) that directly proves this cost overrun was the result of corruption, as opposed to the officially cited reasons (earthquake, blockade, contractor delays, currency fluctuations, and accrued interest).</li>
    </ul>
