  "title": "Corruption Allegations in the Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project",
  "description": "<p>A formal complaint filed at the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) in the Nepali fiscal year 2080 BS (2023/2024 AD) alleges massive corruption amounting to approximately <strong>NPR 51 billion</strong> in the 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project. The complaint, lodged by anti-corruption activist Bishwoniti Prakashman Pakhrin, targets former and current high-ranking officials of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) and the project developer, Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited (UTKHPL).</p><p>The central allegation is that the project's budget was deliberately and corruptly inflated. The initial cost estimate in 2009 was <strong>NPR 35.29 billion</strong> (excluding interest), but the final audited cost upon completion was <strong>NPR 86.68 billion</strong> (including interest during construction). The complaint attributes this massive overrun to widespread irregularities and misuse of authority by officials involved.</p><p>The complaint calls for an investigation into the illicit enrichment of the accused officials and their relatives. Earlier, separate complaints dating back to 2013 had also raised concerns over the use of substandard construction materials and the embezzlement of funds meant for local social development.</p><p>Project officials and reports from UTKHPL have consistently attributed the significant cost and time overruns to several factors, including:</p><ul><li>The devastating <strong>2015 Gorkha Earthquake</strong>, which heavily damaged access roads and project infrastructure.</li><li>The <strong>2015-2016 Indian trade blockade</strong>, which severely hampered the import of materials and equipment.</li><li>Poor performance by the hydro-mechanical contractor (Texmaco of India) in installing penstock pipes.</li><li>Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate, particularly the US dollar.</li><li>Accumulation of significant interest due to prolonged project delays.</li></ul><p>As of late 2023, while the complaint has been registered at the CIAA, there is no public confirmation that a formal case has been filed at the Special Court.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information consists of allegations that have not been substantiated by official court filings or conclusive investigative reports, or details that remain unconfirmed:</p><ul><li><strong>Status of CIAA Investigation:</strong> While it is confirmed that a complaint was filed in 2023, it is <strong>unverified</strong> whether the CIAA has launched a formal, full-scale investigation based on it. There are no public press releases from the CIAA or records from the Special Court to confirm the case is proceeding.</li><li><strong>Direct Proof of Corruption:</strong> The allegation of NPR 51 billion in corruption is primarily based on the large discrepancy between the initial estimated cost and the final project cost. While this is a significant red flag, there is no publicly available evidence (such as audit reports confirming fraud, bank transaction records, or whistleblower testimony) that directly proves this cost overrun was the result of corruption, as opposed to the officially cited reasons (earthquake, blockade, contractor delays, currency fluctuations, and accrued interest).</li><li><strong>Designation of a 'Main Accused':</strong> News reports and the complaint list several individuals. However, the formal designation of a single 'main accused' has not been established by any investigative or judicial body.</li></ul>",
