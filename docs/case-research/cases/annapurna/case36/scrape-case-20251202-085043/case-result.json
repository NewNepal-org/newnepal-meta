  "title": "Ichchha Raj Tamang and Civil Cooperative Fraud and Money Laundering Case",
  "description": "<p>A large-scale financial fraud and money laundering case involving <strong>Ichchha Raj Tamang</strong>, a former Member of Parliament and founder of the Civil Group, who served as the chairman of <strong>Civil Savings and Credit Cooperative Society Limited</strong>. Tamang is accused of embezzling billions of rupees from the cooperative's depositors by illegally diverting funds to his personal real estate ventures, primarily under the 'Civil Homes' brand.</p><p>Investigations by the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police, initiated after complaints from over 1,500 victims, revealed that Tamang channeled approximately 90% of the cooperative's deposits into his own companies, a direct violation of Nepal's Cooperative Act. The cooperative allegedly lured depositors with unusually high interest rates (reportedly up to 17%) and other incentives like gold coins.</p><p>A downturn in the real estate market led to a severe liquidity crisis within the cooperative, preventing thousands of depositors from withdrawing their savings. This led to two major legal actions:</p><ol><li>A <strong>fraud and organized crime case</strong> filed at the Kathmandu District Court against 42 individuals, seeking to recover <strong>NPR 5.67 billion</strong>. This case is currently ongoing.</li><li>A <strong>money laundering case</strong> filed by the Department of Money Laundering Investigation (DMLI) at the Special Court against Tamang and five family members, alleging they laundered embezzled funds.</li></ol><p>On January 21, 2024, the Special Court convicted Ichchha Raj Tamang, his wife Srijana Shakya Tamang, and his associate Keshav Lal Shrestha of money laundering. The court handed down prison sentences, substantial fines, and ordered the confiscation of illegally amassed assets.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Initial reports from August 2021 suggested that the total amount of embezzlement being investigated by the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) was over <strong>Rs 8 billion</strong>. While the formal court filings later specified a claimed amount of Rs 5.67 billion in the fraud case, the initial higher estimate indicates the potential scale of the fraud may have been larger than what was formally prosecuted based on the available victim complaints.</p>",
