### **Description of Case**
<p>The case revolves around Ichchha Raj Tamang, a former Member of Parliament and the promoter of the Civil Group, who established and formerly chaired the Civil Savings and Credit Cooperative Limited. He is accused of orchestrating a large-scale fraud by embezzling billions of rupees from the cooperative's depositors.</p><p>The primary allegation is that Tamang illegally channeled the cooperative's funds into his own private ventures, primarily real estate projects under the 'Civil Homes' brand. Investigations revealed that approximately 90% of the cooperative's deposits, amounting to billions of rupees, were diverted to companies owned by Tamang and his family, which is a direct violation of Nepal's Cooperative Act. To attract a large number of depositors, the cooperative allegedly offered unusually high-interest rates, with some reports mentioning up to 17%, and other incentives like gold coins.</p><p>When the real estate market faced a downturn, the projects failed to generate returns, causing a severe liquidity crisis within the cooperative. As a result, thousands of depositors were unable to withdraw their savings, leading to widespread complaints. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police launched an investigation based on complaints from over 1,500 victims.</p><p>This led to two major legal battles:</p><ol><li>A <strong>fraud and organized crime case</strong> filed at the Kathmandu District Court against 42 individuals, with a claimed amount of over Rs 5.6 billion.</li><li>A separate <strong>money laundering case</strong> filed by the Department of Money Laundering Investigation (DMLI) at the Special Court against Tamang and five family members, alleging they tried to legitimize the embezzled funds.</li></ol><p>In the money laundering case, the Special Court convicted Ichchha Raj Tamang, his wife Srijana Shakya Tamang, and associate Keshav Lal Shrestha in early 2024, handing down prison sentences, substantial fines, and ordering the confiscation of assets. The fraud case at the district court remains ongoing.</p>
