### **Allegations and Key Facts**

<p><strong>The Bribe Demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>An audio recording was leaked to the public on or around April 9, 2023, featuring a conversation allegedly between Dr. Dhaka Kumar Shrestha and Durga Prasai.</li>
    <li>In the recording, a voice identified as Shrestha's is heard asking for NPR 2 crore (20 million) to secure the post of Minister of Health. He allegedly stated he needed the money to pay "the core group members of the party".</li>
    <li>The voice in the audio claims that the party leadership had initially demanded NPR 2.5 crore (25 million) for the ministerial post.</li>
    <li>He is heard suggesting that if he could immediately provide NPR 1 crore (10 million), the party chair, Rabi Lamichhane, would appoint him as the Health Minister.</li>
    <li>The purported reason for wanting the ministry was to "bring about radical reforms in the health sector," which would also benefit Prasai's business interests.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Dr. Shrestha admitted that the voice in the viral audio was his.</li>

<h3>Unverified or Incomplete Information</h3>
<p>The following information is based on initial reports, but the final outcomes are not available in the public domain based on the research conducted:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Final Verdict of the Supreme Court:</strong> While the Supreme Court issued a short-term interim order on May 8, 2023, the final verdict on Dr. Shrestha's petition to be reinstated as a lawmaker could not be found in the search results. It is unclear if his expulsion was ultimately upheld or overturned by the court.</li>
    <li><strong>Outcome of CIAA Investigation:</strong> It was reported on April 11, 2023, that the CIAA had initiated an investigation into the bribery allegations. However, there are no subsequent public reports on whether the CIAA filed a formal corruption case, dropped the investigation, or reached any conclusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Legal Issues:</strong> A separate news report indicates that Dr. Dhaka Kumar Shrestha was arrested and later released on bail of NPR 75,000 by the Kaski District Court in a case related to the alleged illegal sale of psychotropic drugs from his pharmacy. This appears to be a separate legal matter from the bribery allegation.</li>
