  "title": "Dr. Dhaka Kumar Shrestha Bribery Allegation Audio Scandal",
  "description": "<p>The case involves allegations that Dr. Dhaka Kumar Shrestha, a then-lawmaker from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), solicited a bribe of <strong>NPR 2 crore (20 million)</strong> from medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai. The allegation is based on a leaked audio recording of a telephone conversation that was made public on April 9, 2023.</p><p>In the recording, a voice identified as Dr. Shrestha's is heard asking for the funds to secure the position of Minister for Health and Population. The speaker in the audio claims the money is needed to pay 'the core group members of the party' and that party chairman Rabi Lamichhane would appoint him as minister if the funds were arranged.</p><p>Following the leak, the RSP initiated disciplinary proceedings. On April 12, 2023, the party's Central Committee expelled Dr. Shrestha from the party and moved to strip him of his lawmaker post. The Speaker of the House of Representatives later announced his seat as vacant. Dr. Shrestha admitted the voice in the audio was his but claimed the recording, which he said was from January 2023, was edited and part of a conspiracy. He subsequently challenged his expulsion in the Supreme Court, which issued a short-term interim order pausing his removal.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is based on initial reports, but the final outcomes are not available in the public domain based on the research conducted:</p><ul><li><strong>Final Verdict of the Supreme Court:</strong> While the Supreme Court issued a short-term interim order on May 8, 2023, pausing Dr. Shrestha's removal, the final verdict on his petition to be reinstated as a lawmaker is not publicly known. It is unclear if his expulsion was ultimately upheld or overturned by the court.</li><li><strong>Outcome of CIAA Investigation:</strong> It was reported on April 11, 2023, that the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) had initiated an investigation into the bribery allegations. However, there are no subsequent public reports on whether the CIAA filed a formal corruption case, dropped the investigation, or reached any conclusion.</li><li><strong>Separate Legal Issues:</strong> Some news reports indicated that Dr. Shrestha was arrested and later released on bail in a separate case related to the alleged illegal sale of psychotropic drugs from his pharmacy. This appears to be a separate legal matter from the bribery allegation.</li></ul>",
