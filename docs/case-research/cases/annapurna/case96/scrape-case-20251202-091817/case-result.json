  "title": "Murder of Environmental Activist Om Prakash 'Dilip' Mahato",
  "description": "<p>The case involves the murder of 24-year-old environmental activist Om Prakash 'Dilip' Mahato, who was killed on January 10, 2020, for protesting against illegal sand and boulder extraction from the Aurahi River in Dhanusha district. The incident, known as the 'Tipper Terror' case, exposed a criminal nexus involving local crusher industries.</p><p>On the morning of the incident, at approximately 4:00 AM, Mahato went to the river to stop the illegal mining activities conducted by the <strong>Churiyamai Crusher Industry</strong>. According to police investigations and confessions, he was first beaten with an iron rod and then deliberately run over by a tipper truck (Na7Kha 6413) to stage the murder as an accident. The motive was to eliminate his persistent opposition to the illegal mining operations.</p><p>Following the murder, a case was filed at the Dhanusha District Court. In February 2021, the court delivered its verdict:</p><ul><li><strong>Convicted:</strong> Bipin Kumar Mahato (Crusher Owner), Munindra Mahato (Tipper Driver), and Jitendra Kumar Mahato (Loader Driver) were found guilty of murder.</li><li><strong>Acquitted:</strong> Four other individuals—Binod Mahato, Roshan Kumar Yadav, Satyanarayan Mahato, and Shatrughan Mahato—were acquitted.</li></ul><p>The case sparked national outrage and led to sustained activism, with demonstrators demanding justice for Mahato and calling for him to be declared an 'environmental martyr'.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are several unconfirmed but widely reported claims related to this case:</p><ul><li><strong>Monetary Offer for Murder:</strong> It is alleged that the crusher owner, Bipin Mahato, offered the tipper driver, Munindra Mahato, <strong>NPR 50,000</strong> to kill Dilip. Bipin allegedly said, \"He is causing a lot of trouble for our business. He must be killed, otherwise our business will not run.\"</li><li><strong>Prior Threats:</strong> A few days before the murder, Bipin Mahato allegedly threatened Dilip's father, stating that his son \"would be crushed under a tipper if he did not stop protesting against sand excavation.\"</li><li><strong>Intimidation of Family:</strong> Dilip Mahato's family has reported facing ongoing intimidation and surveillance since the murder, allegedly in an effort to pressure them into withdrawing the case or weakening their pursuit of justice.</li></ul>",
