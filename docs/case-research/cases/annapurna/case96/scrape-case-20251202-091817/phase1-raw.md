Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the case of the murder of Om Prakash "Dilip" Mahato.

### **Case Overview**
The case, colloquially known as the "Dojar Atank" or "Tipper Terror," involves the murder of a young environmental activist, Om Prakash "Dilip" Mahato, who was protesting against illegal mining. On January 10, 2020, he was deliberately crushed to death by a tipper truck after being beaten by individuals associated with a local crusher industry in Dhanusha district. The murder exposed the criminal nexus between crusher industries and local political powers, sparking national outrage and continued activism for environmental justice.

### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

#### **Description of Incident**
<p>On the morning of January 10, 2020, at approximately 4:00 AM, 24-year-old Om Prakash "Dilip" Mahato went to the Aurahi River in Sripur, Mithila Municipality-5, Dhanusha, to protest the illegal extraction of sand and boulders. He had been actively opposing these activities, which were being carried out by the Churiyamai Crusher Industry. According to police investigations and confessions, Mahato was attacked at the site. He was first beaten and struck with an iron rod or lever. Subsequently, in an attempt to stage the murder as an accident, he was run over by a tipper truck (registration number Na7Kha 6413).</p>
<p>Police reports indicate that after the initial assault left him unconscious, the perpetrators placed him on the ground and had the truck drive over his head. An iron rod used in the attack was later seized by the police.</p>

#### **Allegations and Motive**
<ul>
    <li><strong>Motive:</strong> The primary motive for the murder was to eliminate Dilip Mahato's persistent opposition to the illegal mining operations, which he had been challenging for two years. His activism was seen as a threat to the business of the crusher industry.</li>
    <li><strong>Prior Threats:</strong> The crusher owner, Bipin Mahato, had threatened Dilip's father days before the murder, stating his son would be crushed by a tipper if he did not stop his protests.</li>
    <li><strong>Conspiracy Claim:</strong> It is alleged that the tipper driver, Munindra Mahato, was offered NPR 50,000 by Bipin Mahato to carry out the killing.</li>
    <li><strong>Cover-up Attempt:</strong> The accused attempted to make the murder look like an accident.</li>
    <li><strong>Intimidation of Family:</strong> Dilip's family has reported facing intimidation and surveillance since the murder in an effort to get them to withdraw the case.</li>
</ul>

#### **Legal Status & Court Rulings**
<p>A murder case was filed at the Dhanusha District Court against seven individuals. In February 2021, the court convicted three people for the murder, while four others were acquitted.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Convicted:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Bipin Kumar Mahato (Crusher Owner)</li>
            <li>Munindra Mahato (Tipper Driver)</li>
            <li>Jitendra Kumar Mahato (Loader Driver)</li>
        </ul>
        The court had initially ordered these three to be held in pre-trial detention.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Acquitted:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Binod Mahato (Bipin's brother)</li>
            <li>Roshan Kumar Yadav (Dilip's friend)</li>
            <li>Satyanarayan Mahato (Worker)</li>
            <li>Shatrughan Mahato (Worker/Head Mistry)</li>
        </ul>
        Roshan, Satyanarayan, and Shatrughan were initially released on bail.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the convictions, activists and family members have expressed fear that the perpetrators were attempting to weaken the case by framing it as an "accidental death" rather than a deliberate murder. In a controversial move on April 13, 2021, a high court bench issued an interim order preventing Dilip's family from interfering with the operations of the crusher factory.</p>
