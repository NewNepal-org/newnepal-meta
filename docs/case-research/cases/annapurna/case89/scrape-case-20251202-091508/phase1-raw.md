### Description

<p>The "Carpet Scandal" (गलैंचा काण्ड) of 1977-78 was a prominent corruption case from Nepal's Panchayat era, centered on allegations of large-scale financial irregularities in the carpet export industry. The primary allegation was the systemic under-invoicing of carpet exports to evade customs duties and illegally retain foreign currency abroad. This practice was believed to cause significant financial loss to the state.</p>

<p>The case gained high-profile status as it implicated the then recently-dismissed Prime Minister, Dr. Tulsi Giri, and 90 other influential individuals, including politicians, senior bureaucrats, and prominent businessmen. The investigation was initiated in 1978 by the Commission for the Control of Abuse of Authority (अख्तियार दुरुपयोग नियन्त्रण आयोग), an anti-graft body that had been formed in 1975. This was reportedly the first major case tackled by the newly-formed commission.</p>

<p>Dr. Giri's cabinet was dissolved by the palace on September 9, 1977, and the corruption charges were brought against him the following year. Publicly addressing the allegations during the political turmoil leading up to the 1979 referendum, Dr. Giri claimed he was a victim of a political conspiracy and stated he was "ready to be hanged if corruption charges against him were proven."</p>

<p>Despite the high-profile nature of the case and the number of individuals involved, available historical records and news archives do not specify the final verdict of the Special Court or any other judicial body that may have handled the case. It is therefore not possible to verify whether Dr. Giri or any of the other 90 accused were convicted, acquitted, or if the case was dismissed.</p>
