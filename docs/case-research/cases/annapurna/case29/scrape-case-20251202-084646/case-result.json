  "title": "Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Transformer Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>A major corruption case involving the procurement of substandard electrical transformers by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) investigated allegations that NEA officials, including top management, colluded with foreign suppliers to purchase transformers that did not meet quality specifications, resulting in significant financial losses for the state and posing risks to public safety.</p><p>The investigation revealed that transformers procured from Chinese and Thai companies in 2011 were defective, most notably using <strong>aluminum wiring instead of the specified copper wiring</strong>. This defect led to high rates of power leakage, frequent explosions, and widespread equipment failure. Consequently, the CIAA filed four separate corruption cases at the Special Court in August and September 2013 against dozens of NEA officials and representatives of supplier companies.</p><p>On <strong>March 28, 2017</strong>, the Special Court delivered its verdict, convicting 20 NEA officials and 5 individuals associated with the supplier companies. The convicted individuals included former NEA Managing Directors Rameshwar Yadav and Dr. Jivendra Jha. The court imposed a combined penalty of approximately <strong>Rs 462 million</strong> in fines and varying jail sentences. The case was subsequently appealed and, as of August 2021, was undergoing final hearings at the Supreme Court.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is unconfirmed or approximate and is included for investigative purposes:</p><ul><li>The CIAA's initial claim across the cases was for a financial loss ranging from <strong>Rs 411.8 million to Rs 500 million</strong>. In one specific case involving 575 transformers, the CIAA sought Rs 79.1 million in fines and an equal amount in compensation.</li><li>The investigation was reportedly expedited after Lokman Singh Karki assumed the role of CIAA chief.</li><li>The CIAA initially sought a bail amount of Rs 175 million from Hu Zheng Qiang of Hubei Sunlight Electric Co Ltd and Rs 180 million from Ou Yang Shi of Sichuan Dongfang Transformer Company. The Supreme Court later significantly reduced the bail amounts for several accused individuals.</li></ul>",
