### Raw Research Findings: Transformer Corruption Case (2070 BS)

**Case Summary:**
The case involves the procurement of substandard transformers by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), leading to significant financial losses and endangering public infrastructure. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) initiated an investigation following reports of frequent transformer malfunctions and fires. The investigation revealed that transformers purchased from Chinese and Thai suppliers were of low quality, notably using aluminum wires instead of the specified copper wires. In 2013 (2070 BS), the CIAA filed four separate corruption cases at the Special Court against dozens of NEA officials, including top management, and representatives of the foreign supplier companies. In March 2017, the Special Court convicted numerous individuals and companies, imposing jail terms and substantial fines.

### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

*   **Core Allegation:** Procurement of low-quality transformers by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) officials in collusion with foreign suppliers, causing massive financial loss to the state.
*   **Nature of Defect:** The primary defect was the use of aluminum wires instead of the specified copper wires in the transformers. This led to excessive power leakage, instability in electricity transmission, and frequent explosions even with minor current fluctuations.
*   **Investigating Body:** The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched the investigation after receiving complaints about malfunctioning and exploding transformers. The investigation was reportedly expedited after Lokman Singh Karki became the CIAA chief.
*   **Legal Action:** The CIAA filed four distinct corruption cases at the Special Court in August 2013 (Shrawan/Bhadra 2070 BS) against NEA officials and supplier companies.
*   **Total Financial Claim (Initial):** The CIAA's initial claim across the cases was for approximately Rs 411.8 million to Rs 500 million in losses due to the procurement of 1,260 transformers in a first phase and 735 in a second phase in 2011. In one of the cases involving 575 transformers from Sichuan Dongfang Transformer Co. Ltd., the CIAA sought Rs 79.1 million in fines and an equal amount in compensation.
*   **Court Verdict:** On March 28, 2017 (Chaitra 15, 2073 BS), the Special Court convicted 20 NEA employees and 5 officials of foreign supplier companies.
*   **Total Fines and Penalties (Special Court):** The court levied a combined fine of approximately Rs 462 million on the perpetrators.
