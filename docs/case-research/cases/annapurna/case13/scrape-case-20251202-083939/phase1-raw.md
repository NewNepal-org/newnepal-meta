Failed to find a specific case matching the details provided. The initial document was a template with no concrete data. Searches for "public land embezzlement" and "sukumbasi" (squatter) corruption in Nepal did not yield a single, officially recognized case with this specific title.

However, the research uncovered several major public land embezzlement scandals and provided context on the broader issue of landless squatters in Nepal. The most prominent of these is the **Lalita Niwas Land Scam**. While not a "Sukumbasi" case, it is the most significant public land embezzlement case in recent Nepali history.

Below is a summary of the findings on the Lalita Niwas case and the general issue of squatters, as no specific "Case 13" could be identified.

### **1. Lalita Niwas Land Grab Scam**

**Description:**
<p>The Lalita Niwas land grab is a high-profile corruption scandal involving the illegal transfer of approximately 143 ropanis of government-owned land in Baluwatar, Kathmandu, to private individuals. This prime real estate houses the official residence of the Prime Minister, the central office of the Nepal Rastra Bank, and other VIP residences. The embezzlement occurred over several years, from approximately 2049 BS to 2069 BS (roughly 1992 to 2012), through the collusion of land brokers, government officials, ministers, and business groups who forged documents and abused their authority to transfer ownership.</p><p>The scheme was allegedly masterminded by land brokers Shobhakant Dhakal and Ram Kumar Subedi, along with Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket. They are accused of conspiring with officials to create fake tenants and manipulate government records to sell the land to various business houses and individuals.</p><p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police have led the investigations. The CIAA filed a corruption case against 175 individuals at the Special Court on February 5, 2020. Later, in August 2023, the District Government Attorney's Office in Kathmandu filed a separate case on charges of forgery against 290 people, seeking to recover over Rs 18 billion.</p>

**Main Accused:**
The case implicates a wide range of individuals, including:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alleged Masterminds/Brokers:</strong> Shobhakant Dhakal, Ram Kumar Subedi, Min Bahadur Gurung.</li>

</ul>
Former Prime Ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai were also questioned by the CIB regarding cabinet decisions made during their tenures that facilitated the land transfers, though the CIAA had earlier exempted them, citing that policy decisions were beyond its investigative purview.

### **2. General Issue of "Sukumbasi" (Squatters) and Land Management**

**Description:**
<p>The term "Sukumbasi" refers to the long-standing and complex issue of landless squatters in Nepal. It is a major social and political challenge rather than a single corruption case. Over the past 70 years, Nepal has formed at least 22 different commissions to address the problem, but a sustainable solution remains elusive. These commissions have distributed approximately 47,000 bighas of land to 150,000 families, yet the problem persists.</p><p>These commissions are often criticized for being politically motivated. For instance, the Landless Squatters' Commission formed by the Baburam Bhattarai-led government was dissolved in 2013 amid allegations that it was distributing identity cards to party supporters to influence elections. Governments have repeatedly formed and dissolved these bodies, often with changes in political leadership, hindering long-term progress. The Supreme Court has also intervened, ordering the government to clear riverbank encroachments in Kathmandu but also to ensure alternative housing for genuine squatters, acknowledging their constitutional right to housing.</p>

**Key Points:**
<ul>
    <li><strong>Systemic Problem:</strong> The squatter issue is a recurring social problem, not a specific criminal case of embezzlement.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Appointments:</strong> Commissions to solve the squatter problem are often filled with political appointees, leading to accusations of politicization and patronage.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal and Human Rights Dimensions:</strong> There is a constant tension between enforcing laws against the encroachment of public land and protecting the constitutional right to housing for genuine landless citizens.</li>
    <li><strong>Vast Numbers:</strong> As of February 2024, the National Land Commission had received over 1.4 million applications from landless and unorganized settlers.</li>
