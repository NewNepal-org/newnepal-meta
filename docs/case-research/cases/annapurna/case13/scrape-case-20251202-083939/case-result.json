  "title": "Lalita Niwas Land Grab Scam",
  "description": "<p>The Lalita Niwas land grab is a high-profile corruption scandal in Nepal involving the illegal transfer and privatization of approximately <strong>143 ropanis (around 18 acres) of government-owned land</strong> in Baluwatar, Kathmandu. This prime real estate is location to the Prime Minister's official residence, the Nepal Rastra Bank's central office, and other VIP residences. The land was originally acquired by the government from the family of Subarna Shamsher Rana in the 1960s.</p><p>The embezzlement occurred over a prolonged period, from approximately 1992 to 2012. It involved a complex conspiracy between land brokers, government officials, cabinet ministers, and business groups. The scheme involved several illicit methods:</p><ul><li>Forging government documents and creating fake tenants.</li><li>Manipulating official records to claim land that was legally acquired by the state.</li><li>Abusing authority through cabinet-level policy decisions to legitimize the transfers.</li></ul><p>Investigations by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police have unraveled the scheme. On February 5, 2020, the CIAA filed a corruption case at the Special Court against 175 individuals, seeking to reclaim the land. Subsequently, on August 27, 2023, the District Government Attorney's Office in Kathmandu filed a separate case on charges of forgery against 290 individuals, seeking to recover over <strong>NPR 18 billion</strong> in damages.</p><p>The case has implicated several high-ranking officials and prominent business figures, making it one of the most significant anti-corruption cases in Nepal's recent history. A Special Court verdict in February 2024 convicted several key conspirators while acquitting some former ministers, and ordered the sequestration of the illegally transferred land.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While investigations have been extensive, certain aspects remain subject to further clarification:</p><ul><li><strong>Involvement of Former Prime Ministers:</strong> Former Prime Ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai were questioned by the CIB regarding cabinet decisions made during their tenures that facilitated the land transfers. However, the CIAA had previously exempted them from prosecution, citing that policy-level decisions made by the cabinet were outside its jurisdiction. Their exact level of culpability remains a point of public and legal debate.</li><li><strong>Role of Business Groups:</strong> The involvement of several business houses, including the <strong>Goyal, Sarda, Chachan, and Kedia groups</strong>, has been mentioned in investigation reports and media coverage as beneficiaries of the land grab. The precise nature and legality of their land acquisition and their role in the conspiracy require further detailed verification from court documents.</li></ul>",
