Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the Chase Air scandal involving Nepal Airlines Corporation.

### **Case Summary**
The Chase Air scandal of 1997-1998 involved the state-owned Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC), which paid a substantial advance to a fraudulent American company, Chase Air, for the lease of a Boeing 757 aircraft that was never delivered. The deal was signed during a coalition government led by Girija Prasad Koirala, at a time when the Ministry of Tourism was held by the CPN-ML party. The case involved allegations of political corruption, led to legal battles in both Nepal and the United States, and resulted in a significant financial loss for the national airline.

### **Description of the Incident & Allegations**
<p>In 1997, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) entered into an agreement to lease a Boeing 757 aircraft to supplement its fleet. The deal was made with a purported US company named 'Chase Air'. An advance payment, cited by most sources as $783,750, was wired to the company. However, the aircraft never arrived.</p>
<p>Subsequent investigations, including one by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in Nepal and another by the FBI in the United States, revealed that Chase Air was a fraudulent entity. Key findings from the investigations include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fictitious Company:</strong> Chase Air was a shell company with no actual aircraft or substantial office. It was created specifically for this fraudulent transaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Forged Documents:</strong> The proprietor, Cecil Winters, used forged documents to convince RNAC officials. An FBI probe discovered that the aircraft registration certificate provided to RNAC was a forgery; the name of the real aircraft owner had been physically covered, and 'Chase Air' was typed over it.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Appointments:</strong> The appointment of RNAC's Executive Chairman, Hong Kong Ranamagar, was political. He was appointed by then-Tourism Minister Yamlal Kandel and was known to be an associate of Bamdev Gautam, the leader of the CPN (ML) party, which was a junior partner in the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scandal was one of several major corruption cases that plagued the airline throughout the 1990s and 2000s, contributing to its financial decline.</p>

### **Legal and Investigative Actions**
<p><strong>In Nepal:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>The <strong>Public Accounts Committee (PAC)</strong> investigated the deal and, in its report, determined that the scam caused a loss of approximately 10 Crore NPR to the corporation.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)</strong> filed a corruption case against RNAC's Executive Director, Hong Kong Ranamagar.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Special Court</strong> found Ranamagar guilty of corruption and sentenced him to a three-year jail term around 2003.</li>
    <li>On March 25, 2009, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> overturned the verdict and gave a "clean cheat" to Hong Kong Ranamagar, acquitting him of all charges.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In the United States:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>RNAC hired legal counsel and initiated a civil case in New York to try and recover the lost funds.</li>
    <li>The case was reported to the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</strong> as a fraud, which then launched a criminal investigation led by Special Agent Carla L. Holmes.</li>
    <li>The FBI's investigation successfully tracked the movement of the stolen funds, which Cecil Winters had transferred through various bank and brokerage accounts, including a $470,000 transfer to a DLJ Pershing brokerage account and subsequent transfers to his lawyers' accounts in Alabama and Florida.</li>
</ol>

### **Unverified Information**
*   The final outcome of the US criminal proceedings against Cecil Winters is not detailed in the available sources.
*   The full official report from the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was not found, though its conclusions on the loss amount are widely cited.
