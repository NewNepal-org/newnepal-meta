  "title": "Chase Air Scam (1997)",
  "description": "<p>The Chase Air scam refers to a fraudulent aircraft lease agreement in 1997-1998 involving the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC), now Nepal Airlines Corporation. RNAC paid a substantial advance to a fraudulent American company, <strong>Chase Air</strong>, for the lease of a Boeing 757 aircraft that was never delivered, resulting in a significant financial loss for the national airline.</p><p>The deal was orchestrated during a coalition government led by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. The RNAC Executive Chairman, <strong>Hong Kong Ranamagar</strong>, appointed by the then Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, Yamlal Kandel, approved the deal. An advance payment of <strong>$783,750</strong> was wired to Chase Air.</p><p>Subsequent investigations by Nepal's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed that Chase Air was a shell company created by <strong>Cecil Winters</strong> specifically for this fraud. The FBI found that Winters had used forged documents to legitimize the deal, including an altered aircraft registration certificate.</p><p><strong>Legal and Investigative Actions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>In Nepal:</strong> The PAC concluded the scam caused a loss of approximately 10 Crore NPR. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against Hong Kong Ranamagar. He was initially convicted by the Special Court and sentenced to three years in prison. However, on March 25, 2009, the Supreme Court of Nepal acquitted him of all charges.</li><li><strong>In the United States:</strong> RNAC initiated a civil case to recover funds, and the FBI launched a criminal investigation into Cecil Winters for fraud. The FBI tracked the movement of the stolen funds through various bank and brokerage accounts.</li></ul><p>This scandal is one of several major corruption cases that plagued the airline during the 1990s and 2000s, contributing to its long-term financial decline.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Certain details of the case remain unverified or contain conflicting information:</p><ul><li><strong>Precise Financial Loss:</strong> While the advance payment is widely cited as $783,750, some sources mention a lost amount of over $900,000. Nepali media reports also cite varying figures, such as 5 Crore 34 Lakh Rupees (53.4 million NPR), while the PAC's conclusion was a loss of approximately 10 Crore NPR (100 million NPR).</li><li><strong>US Legal Outcome:</strong> The final outcome of the US criminal proceedings against the fraud's mastermind, Cecil Winters, is not detailed in the available sources.</li><li><strong>Specific Dates:</strong> The exact date in 1997 for the signing of the lease agreement and the subsequent wire transfer of funds is not specified in the records.</li><li><strong>Official Documents:</strong> The full official report from the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is not publicly available, though its conclusions are widely reported.</li></ul>",
