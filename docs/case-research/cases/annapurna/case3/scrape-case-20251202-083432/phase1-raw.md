## Dhamija Scandal Rocks Nepal Airlines, Implicating Top Political Figures

**Kathmandu, Nepal** - In the year 2050 BS (1993 AD), the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC), now Nepal Airlines, was embroiled in a major corruption case widely known as the "Dhamija Scandal." The controversy revolved around the appointment of a General Sales Agent (GSA) for Europe, which allegedly resulted in a financial loss of approximately **NPR 40 crore 55 lakh** (around 39 crore 55 lakh according to some sources) to the national flag carrier. The scandal implicated high-level political figures, including the then Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, and brought his daughter, Sujata Koirala, into the political spotlight amid allegations of her connection to the affair.

### Allegations and Key Figures

The central figure in the scandal was **Dinesh Dhamija**, a British-Indian businessman. In April 1993, Dhamija's UK-based "Fair Company" was appointed as the sole GSA for RNAC's European operations. The appointment was allegedly made in an arbitrary manner, bypassing standard procedures, under undue pressure and direct intervention from Prime Minister **Girija Prasad Koirala**.

Allegations of cronyism were rampant, citing the close relationship between Dhamija and Koirala as the reason for the appointment. Sources claim that Sujata Koirala was allegedly behind her father's involvement in the scandal, and the controversy marked her emergence into the political scene.

### Timeline of Events

*   **1993 (2050 BS):** Dinesh Dhamija's Fair Company is appointed as the GSA for Royal Nepal Airlines in Europe. The decision is allegedly pushed through by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
*   **Post-Appointment:** Allegations of irregularities and financial losses to the airline begin to surface, leading to public and political outcry. The estimated loss is reported to be between NPR 39.55 crore and 40.55 crore.
*   **Parliamentary Intervention:** The deal becomes a major political issue, leading to a parliamentary investigation. Prime Minister Koirala was called to answer questions before the Public Accounts Committee. The controversy was fueled by internal dissent within the ruling Nepali Congress party, with some members, like Kuber Sharma, demanding a full investigation into Koirala's role.
*   **1994 (2051 BS):** Following the mid-term elections, the newly formed government led by the CPN-UML established a commission headed by Gajendramani Pradhan to investigate the scandal.
