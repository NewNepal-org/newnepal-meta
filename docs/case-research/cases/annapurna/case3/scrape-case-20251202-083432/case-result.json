  "title": "Nepal Airlines Dhamija GSA Scandal (1993)",
  "description": "<p>The Dhamija Scandal of 1993 (2050 BS) is a major corruption case involving the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC), now Nepal Airlines. The controversy centered on the appointment of a General Sales Agent (GSA) for Europe, which allegedly caused a financial loss of approximately <strong>NPR 39 crore 55 lakh</strong> to the state-owned airline.</p><p>The scandal revolves around the appointment of <strong>Dinesh Dhamija</strong>, a British-Indian businessman, whose UK-based company 'Fair Company' was designated as the sole GSA for RNAC's European operations in April 1993. The appointment was allegedly made in an irregular and arbitrary manner, bypassing standard procedures. Accusations pointed to direct intervention and undue pressure from the then Prime Minister, <strong>Girija Prasad Koirala</strong>, who was said to have a close relationship with Dhamija.</p><p>The deal sparked significant political and public outcry, leading to several investigations:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Public Accounts Committee (PAC)</strong> of the Parliament initiated a probe and summoned Prime Minister Koirala for questioning.</li><li>Following the 1994 mid-term elections, the new CPN-UML government formed a judicial commission led by <strong>Gajendramani Pradhan</strong> to investigate the matter.</li><li>The legality of the Pradhan Commission was later challenged in the Supreme Court in 1995. Concurrently, a writ petition was filed demanding an investigation by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).</li></ul><p>The Dhamija scandal is frequently cited as one of the most significant corruption cases in the history of Nepal's national flag carrier, highlighting issues of political interference and lack of transparency in state-owned enterprises.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The exact role of <strong>Sujata Koirala</strong>, daughter of the then Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, remains largely unclarified in official documents. While multiple news sources allege she was connected to the scandal and that the controversy marked her entry into politics, the specific nature of her involvement in the appointment of Dinesh Dhamija is not detailed.</p><p>There is a slight discrepancy in the reported financial loss, with figures ranging from <strong>NPR 39.55 crore</strong> to <strong>NPR 40.55 crore</strong>.</p><p>Some reports suggest that Dinesh Dhamija later won a court battle against Nepal Airlines concerning the termination of the GSA contract, but specific details of this legal case, including the court, jurisdiction, and judgment date, are not readily available in the public domain.</p>",
