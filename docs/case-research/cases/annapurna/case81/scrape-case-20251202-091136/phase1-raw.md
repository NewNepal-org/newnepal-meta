### 6. Unverified Information

<p>The online search results did not provide specific details matching the main accused, year, and loss amount mentioned in the initial case file. The searches did, however, reveal a broader history of issues concerning the Chandannath Bhairavnath Guthi's land:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There have been persistent problems with the encroachment of the Guthi's land in Jumla for building roads and private structures.</li>
    <li>A 2019 report noted that out of approximately 205 ropani (about 104,000 square meters) of land belonging to the Chandannath Rajguthi, a significant portion of about 108 ropani has fallen into private hands.</li>
    <li>Past committee members have stated that land was illicitly registered in private names during land surveys, with the irregularities being discovered much later.</li>
    <li>The Guthi's land is considered highly valuable as it is located in the middle of Jumla market, making it a target for encroachment and unauthorized long-term use.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these points provide context on the vulnerability of the Guthi's property, they do not directly corroborate the specific allegations against Jaykrishna Acharya from the year 2063.</p>
