  "description": "<p>This case involves alleged corruption in the leasing of land and sheds (टहरा) belonging to the <strong>Chandannath Bhairavnath Guthi</strong> during the Nepali fiscal year 2063 B.S. (approximately 2006-2007 A.D.).</p><p>The primary accused, <strong>Jaykrishna Acharya</strong>, is alleged to have manipulated the leasing process for the Guthi's property. This action purportedly led to a direct financial loss of <strong>NPR 201,000</strong> for the Guthi. The District Administration Office has also been implicated in connection with the case, although its specific role is not detailed in the available information.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While the specific allegations against Jaykrishna Acharya for the year 2063 B.S. are noted from an internal file, public domain searches did not corroborate these details. However, the searches revealed a broader and persistent history of issues concerning the Chandannath Bhairavnath Guthi's land, providing important context:</p><ul><li>There have been ongoing problems with the <strong>encroachment of the Guthi's land</strong> in Jumla, which has been used for building roads and private structures.</li><li>A 2019 report by <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/rampant-encroachment-of-guthi-land-in-jumla/\">myRepublica</a> noted that of the Guthi's approximately 205 ropani of land, a significant portion of about 108 ropani has fallen into private hands.</li><li>Past committee members have stated that land was illicitly registered in private names during land surveys, with these irregularities often being discovered much later.</li><li>The Guthi's land is considered highly valuable as it is located in the middle of the Jumla market, making it a prime target for encroachment and unauthorized long-term use.</li></ul><p>These points highlight the systemic vulnerability of the Guthi's assets but do not directly confirm the specific charges against Jaykrishna Acharya from 2006-2007.</p>",
