Here is the comprehensive report on the case involving the transfer of Nepal Trust land during the tenure of former Prime Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai.

### **Case Details**

**id:** 95
**case_name:** Transfer of Nepal Trust Land to Individuals
**status:** Under Investigation
**summary:** During his tenure as Prime Minister, Dr. Baburam Bhattarai's cabinet made a "policy decision" that led to the transfer of approximately 173 ropani of land owned by the Nepal Trust into the names of private individuals (tenants). The decision, implemented in 2070 BS (2013 AD) by the Land Revenue Office in Kalanki, is alleged to be illegal as it violates the Nepal Trust Act, 2064, which prohibits the sale or transfer of trust property, and the Land Act, 2021, which bars tenancy rights on government land. Investigations have been initiated by the Nepal Trust and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). Dr. Bhattarai has defended the move, stating it was a legitimate policy decision to grant land to long-standing tenants based on the recommendations of several probe committees.

### **Description**

<p>The case revolves around the transfer of approximately <strong>173 ropani and 5 paisa of land</strong> belonging to the Nepal Trust into the names of about 100 private individuals. This land, formerly owned by the late King Birendra and his family, was located across several areas in Kathmandu, including Mata Tirtha, Mahadevsthan (Thankot), Satungal, and Ichangu Narayan (Balaju).</p><p>The transfer was executed based on a purported "policy decision" by the Council of Ministers chaired by then-Prime Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai. At the time, Dr. Bhattarai was the Patron of the Nepal Trust, and Deputy Prime Minister Vijay Kumar Gachhadar was the Chairman of its board. A proposal was reportedly introduced in the cabinet on Bhadra 3, 2069 (circa August 19, 2012) by then-Cabinet Secretary Jaymukunda Khanal, which suggested that former royal "Farmayasi Birta" lands should be registered under the names of the tenants cultivating them. Another report points to a cabinet decision on Kartik 2, 2069 (October 18, 2012) as the basis for the transfer. Subsequently, on <strong>Asar 7, 2070 (June 21, 2013)</strong>, the Land Revenue Office in Kalanki officially registered the land plots in the names of the tenants (mohi).</p><p>The legality of this action has been severely questioned. The core of the allegation is that the transfer directly contravenes <strong>Section 13 of the Nepal Trust Act, 2064</strong>, which explicitly prohibits the sale, disposal, or transfer of Trust property. Additionally, a probe committee formed by the Nepal Trust later cited <strong>Section 25(5) of the Land Act, 2021</strong>, which states that tenancy rights cannot be established on land owned by the Government of Nepal.</p><p>Further controversy stems from the legitimacy of the cabinet decision itself. It has been reported that the supposed cabinet decision from Bhadra 25, 2069, which was used to justify the action, does not actually contain any directive to grant full ownership to tenants, nor was it ever published in the Nepal Gazette. The then-Land Reform Minister, Chandra Dev Joshi, has publicly stated that the cabinet never made such a decision and that he resigned from his post due to immense pressure related to the matter.</p><p>In his defense, Dr. Baburam Bhattarai has consistently maintained that the action was a legitimate policy decision aimed at providing land to genuine, long-term tenants who had been paying taxes on the land for decades, with some records going back to 2004 BS (circa 1947 AD). He asserts that the decision was not made unilaterally but was based on the findings and recommendations of four separate probe committees.</p>

### **Unverified Info**
<p>There are multiple dates cited for the key cabinet decision. One is Bhadra 25, 2069, which is disputed. Another is Kartik 2, 2069 (October 18, 2012), cited in the Nepal Trust's white paper as a decision by the cabinet's bill committee. The exact sequence and nature of the proposal by Secretary Jaymukund Khanal on Bhadra 3, 2069, and its relation to the final decision requires further clarification.</p>
