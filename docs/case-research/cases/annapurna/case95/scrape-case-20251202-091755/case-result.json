  "title": "Transfer of Nepal Trust Land to Individuals during Baburam Bhattarai's Premiership",
  "description": "<p>The case concerns the transfer of approximately <strong>173 ropani of land</strong> belonging to the Nepal Trust to around 100 private individuals. The land, formerly owned by the late King Birendra and his family, is located in Mata Tirtha, Mahadevsthan (Thankot), Satungal, and Ichangu Narayan areas of Kathmandu.</p><p>The transfer was executed based on a 'policy decision' made by the Council of Ministers chaired by then-Prime Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai. At the time, Dr. Bhattarai was the Patron of the Nepal Trust, and Deputy Prime Minister Vijay Kumar Gachhadar was its Chairman. Following a cabinet decision, the Land Revenue Office in Kalanki officially registered the land in the names of tenants (mohi) on <strong>June 21, 2013</strong> (Asar 7, 2070 BS).</p><p>The legality of this action has been strongly challenged. The core allegations are that the transfer violates:</p><ul><li><strong>Section 13 of the Nepal Trust Act, 2064</strong>, which prohibits the sale, disposal, or transfer of Trust property.</li><li><strong>Section 25(5) of the Land Act, 2021</strong>, which states that tenancy rights cannot be established on land owned by the Government of Nepal.</li></ul><p>A probe committee formed by the Nepal Trust later concluded the transfer was illegal and recommended the land be reclaimed. The legitimacy of the cabinet decision itself is also disputed, with then-Land Reform Minister Chandra Dev Joshi publicly denying that the cabinet made such a decision to transfer ownership.</p><p>In his defense, Dr. Baburam Bhattarai has maintained that it was a legitimate policy decision to provide land to genuine, long-term tenants who had been paying taxes on the land for decades, and that the decision was based on the recommendations of four separate probe committees.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are conflicting dates cited for the key cabinet decision that authorized the land transfer. One reported date is Bhadra 25, 2069 BS, which has been disputed, with reports claiming the official decision record does not contain the directive for ownership transfer. Another date, Kartik 2, 2069 BS (October 18, 2012), is cited in the Nepal Trust's white paper as the date of a decision by the cabinet's bill committee. The exact nature and influence of a proposal reportedly tabled by then-Cabinet Secretary Jaymukunda Khanal on Bhadra 3, 2069 BS (August 19, 2012) also require further clarification.</p>",
