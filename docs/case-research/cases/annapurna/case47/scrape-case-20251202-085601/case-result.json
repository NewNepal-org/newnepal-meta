  "title": "Apex Development Bank Embezzlement Case",
  "description": "<p>A major banking fraud case involving the embezzlement of over <strong>NPR 1.5 billion</strong> from the erstwhile Apex Development Bank. The fraud was allegedly orchestrated by officials, promoters, and staff of the bank after it had signed a memorandum of understanding to merge with Nepal Credit and Commerce (NCC) Bank but before the merger was finalized.</p><p>The irregularities were discovered by NCC Bank following the merger. NCC Bank reported its findings to Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank, which conducted a preliminary investigation. Finding evidence of significant embezzlement, NRB handed the case to the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police for a criminal probe.</p><p>The CIB's investigation revealed a systematic scheme to siphon funds through fraudulent lending practices. The key methods included:</p><ul><li>Approving loans against fake or significantly over-valued land collateral.</li><li>Creating 'artificial borrowers' to receive loan funds.</li><li>Accepting and processing loans based on forged documents, such as fake income statements.</li><li>Practicing 'loan evergreening' by issuing new loans to borrowers who had already defaulted on previous ones, in order to hide non-performing assets.</li></ul><p>The fraudulent activities were traced to several branches, including Durbar Marg, Lokanthali, Itahari, Surkhet, and Nepalgunj. In March 2018, the CIB arrested 13 individuals, including the former chairman and senior managers. By May 2018, the CIB had filed charges against a total of 148 individuals at the Lalitpur District Court under the Banking Offence and Punishment Act, 2064 (2008 AD).</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<ul><li>The final court verdict and specific sentences for the 148 individuals accused in the case have not been publicly confirmed in the available reports.</li><li>The status of the two alleged masterminds, former CEO Govinda Upadhyaya and board member Basanta Malla, who were reported to have fled to the United States, is unknown. It is not confirmed if an Interpol diffusion notice was successfully issued or if they were ever apprehended.</li><li>The exact total amount recovered from the embezzled funds is not specified. While the total fraud was estimated at over NPR 1.5 billion, the amount successfully retrieved through asset seizure or other means is not detailed.</li></ul>",
