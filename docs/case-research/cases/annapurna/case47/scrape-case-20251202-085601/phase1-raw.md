### Raw Findings: Apex Development Bank Embezzlement Case

#### **1. Case Summary**

**Subject:** Apex Development Bank (later merged with Nepal Credit and Commerce Bank)

**Issue:** Banking Fraud / Embezzlement

**Year of Discovery/Action:** 2018 (corresponding to late 2074 / early 2075 BS)

**Alleged Loss:** Over NPR 1.5 billion. Some reports cite the amount as NPR 1.6 billion.

**Summary of Allegations:**
Officials and promoters of the erstwhile Apex Development Bank are accused of embezzling over NPR 1.5 billion by issuing loans fraudulently. The fraud was allegedly committed after the bank had signed a memorandum of understanding to merge with Nepal Credit and Commerce (NCC) Bank but before the merger was finalized. The methods involved approving loans against fake or over-valued collateral, to fake borrowers, and to individuals with poor credit histories. The irregularities were discovered by NCC Bank following the merger, which then reported the matter to Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), leading to a formal investigation by the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police.
