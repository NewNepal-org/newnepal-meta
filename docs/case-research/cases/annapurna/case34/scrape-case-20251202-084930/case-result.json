  "title": "Illegal Limestone Excavation and Collusion Case (CIAA vs. DMG and Cement Companies)",
  "description": "<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a major corruption case on <strong>January 26, 2022</strong>, at the Special Court in Kathmandu. The case accused nine cement and mining companies of illegally excavating limestone far beyond their permitted quantities. It also implicated senior officials at the <strong>Department of Mines and Geology (DMG)</strong> for alleged collusion in waiving the fines for this over-excavation, causing a significant revenue loss to the state.</p><p>An initial investigation committee within the DMG, formed on May 28, 2019, had concluded that the companies caused a revenue loss of <strong>NPR 1.26 billion</strong> and recommended its recovery. However, after a change in leadership at the DMG, a subsequent committee drastically reduced the recoverable amount to just NPR 1.8 million. This suspicious reduction prompted the CIAA to launch its own investigation, which led to the filing of the case seeking to recover <strong>NPR 1.24 billion</strong> from the accused parties.</p><p>The accused included prominent industrialist and former FNCCI president Pashupati Murarka, nine DMG officials including then Director General Ram Prasad Ghimire, and the proprietors of the nine companies. The amounts claimed from each company were:</p><ul><li><strong>Siddhartha Minerals Pvt. Ltd.:</strong> NPR 494.55 million</li><li><strong>Maruti Cement Ltd.:</strong> NPR 205 million</li><li><strong>Sarbottam Cement:</strong> NPR 163 million</li><li><strong>Annapurna Quarries:</strong> NPR 111 million</li><li><strong>United Cement:</strong> NPR 96 million</li><li><strong>Sonapur Minerals and Oil Limited:</strong> NPR 69 million</li><li><strong>Dolomite Chundhunga Udyog:</strong> NPR 54 million</li><li><strong>Kanchan Quarries:</strong> NPR 30 million</li><li><strong>Udaipur Mineral Tech:</strong> NPR 17.97 million</li></ul><p>On <strong>March 17, 2023</strong>, the Special Court, in a verdict delivered by a bench of judges Ramesh Kumar Pokharel, Balbhadra Bastola, and Khushi Prasad Tharu, acquitted all 18 individuals and the 9 companies of all corruption charges. More details on the verdict can be found in the <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/03/18/special-court-clears-27-defendants-including-factory-owners-of-graft-charges\">Kathmandu Post report</a>.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information contains discrepancies or could not be fully verified from the available sources:</p><ul><li><strong>Supreme Court Appeal:</strong> It is not clear from the provided sources whether the CIAA has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court against the Special Court's acquittal verdict.</li><li><strong>Exact Corruption Amount:</strong> There are slight variations in the reported revenue loss. The initial DMG committee cited NPR 1.26 billion, while the CIAA's final case sought NPR 1.24 billion. Some reports round this figure to NPR 1.3 billion. The precise figure in the final charge sheet is NPR 1,244,367,784.</li><li><strong>Palpa Forest Case Date:</strong> A separate case was filed by the Division Forest Office, Palpa, against Siddhartha Minerals for excavating on excess forest land. Sources report conflicting filing dates of November 14 and November 19, 2024. A date in 2024 would be in the future relative to the publication of the articles. This may be a typo in the source articles or a misunderstanding of the Nepali calendar date (Bikram Samvat). One source URL contains '2024/11/19', indicating the likely origin of this date.</li></ul>",
