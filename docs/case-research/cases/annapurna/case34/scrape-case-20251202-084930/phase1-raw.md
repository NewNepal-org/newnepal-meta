### Raw Findings: Case on Illegal Limestone Excavation

Based on the initial information and extensive search, here are the detailed raw findings regarding the corruption case involving illegal limestone excavation by several cement companies.

#### 1. Case Summary

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a major corruption case on January 26, 2022, at the Special Court in Kathmandu. The case involves allegations that nine cement and mining companies illegally excavated limestone beyond their permitted quantities, and that officials at the Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) colluded to waive the resulting fines, causing a significant revenue loss to the government. The total loss was initially estimated at over NPR 1.26 billion, but the CIAA sought to recover NPR 1.24 billion.

However, on March 17, 2023, the Special Court, in a verdict by a bench of judges Ramesh Kumar Pokharel, Balbhadra Bastola, and Khushi Prasad Tharu, acquitted all 18 individuals and the nine companies of all corruption charges. The CIAA has the option to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court.

#### 3. Timeline of Events

*   **May 28, 2019:** A three-member committee, led by the then-Deputy Director General of the DMG, Ram Prasad Ghimire, is formed to investigate illegal mining. This committee's report concludes that nine cement companies excavated more limestone than permitted, causing a revenue loss of NPR 1.26 billion. It recommended recovering this amount.
*   **July 16, 2019:** The Ram Prasad Ghimire-led committee officially recommends recovering the lost revenue from the companies.
*   **Post-July 2019:** After being promoted to Director General, Ram Prasad Ghimire forms a new investigative committee headed by Jayaraj Ghimire.
*   **Date Unspecified:** The Jayaraj Ghimire-led committee reviews the initial findings and recommends recovering only NPR 1.8 million from the companies, along with a fine of Rs 100,000 each for the fiscal years 2017-18 and 2018-19. This drastic reduction prompted the CIAA to launch its own investigation.
*   **January 26, 2022:** The CIAA files a corruption case at the Special Court against 18 individuals and 9 companies, seeking to recover NPR 1.24 billion.
*   **March 17, 2023:** The Special Court acquits all defendants in the case.

#### 4. Allegations and Financial Discrepancies

*   **Core Allegation:** Nine cement companies were accused of excavating limestone in quantities far exceeding what their licenses permitted. Government officials from the Department of Mines and Geology were accused of colluding to help these companies evade fines.
*   **Initial Assessed Loss:** An investigation led by Ram Prasad Ghimire (before he became DG) determined the revenue loss to be **NPR 1.26 billion**.
*   **Revised Amount:** A subsequent committee, formed by Ram Prasad Ghimire after his promotion to DG, drastically reduced the recoverable amount to just **NPR 1.8 million**.
*   **CIAA Claim:** The CIAA, finding the reduction suspicious, filed a case claiming a total loss of **NPR 1.24 billion**.
*   **Pashupati Murarka's Specific Claim:** The largest single claim was against Pashupati Murarka's Siddhartha Minerals Pvt. Ltd., amounting to **NPR 494.5 million**.

#### 5. Related Legal Issues for Siddhartha Minerals

*   Separately, the Division Forest Office in Palpa filed a case at the Palpa District Court on **November 14 (Year unclear, likely 2024)** against Siddhartha Minerals.
*   **Allegation:** The company was permitted to excavate on 5 hectares of forest land in Shridanda, Tinau Rural Municipality-3, Palpa, but allegedly used 7.2 hectares, illegally excavating forest resources. The claim for this case is for NPR 3.96 million.
*   **Defendants:** Pashupati Murarka and company directors Jagdish Kumar Agrawal, Manoj Kumar Kedia, Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, and Binod Kumar Shrestha.
*   **Outcome:** Pashupati Murarka appeared in court and was released on bail after depositing NPR 400,000.

#### 6. Quotes and Denials

*   **Pashupati Murarka (on the forest land case):** "We have only excavated within the allocated area authorized under our operational rights. All activities have been conducted per the approval of Department of Mines and Geology."
*   **CIAA Statement (on the main corruption case):** The CIAA alleged that after becoming Director General, Ram Prasad Ghimire formed the second committee with "the intention of exempting” almost all the amount determined by the previous committee he himself had led.

#### 7. Unverified Information

*   The initial document states the loss was "1.3 arba," which is approximately NPR 1.3 billion. News reports cite slightly different figures from the CIAA charge sheet, specifically NPR 1.26 billion and NPR 1.24 billion. The 1.3 billion figure appears to be a rounded number.
*   The exact year for the Palpa District Court case against Siddhartha Minerals is reported as November 14 and November 19, 2024, in one article, which is in the future relative to some publication dates. Another source mentions the case was filed on Kartik 29 (late October/early November), suggesting a possible year of 2081 BS (2024 AD), but the year needs definitive verification.
*   It is not clear from the search results whether the CIAA has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court following the Special Court's acquittal verdict.
