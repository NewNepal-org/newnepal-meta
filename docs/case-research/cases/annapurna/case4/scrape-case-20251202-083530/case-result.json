  "title": "Lalita Niwas Land Grab Scam",
  "description": "<p>The Lalita Niwas land grab is a major corruption scandal in Nepal involving the illegal privatization of approximately <strong>143 ropanis of government-owned land</strong> in Baluwatar, Kathmandu. This land is part of a larger complex that houses the Prime Minister's official residence and the Nepal Rastra Bank's central office. The land was originally acquired by the government in 1961 under the Land Acquisition Act after providing compensation to its owner, Subarna Shamsher Rana.</p><p>The scam was orchestrated over several decades, reportedly between 1992 and 2012, through a conspiracy involving land revenue officials, brokers, businesspersons, and high-level political figures. The perpetrators allegedly forged government documents and manipulated cabinet-level policy decisions to transfer the state-owned land to private individuals and business groups.</p><p><strong>Key phases of the scam include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>1992:</strong> Officials at the Dillibazar Land Revenue Office illegally transferred 113 ropanis of government-acquired land back to private individuals, allegedly misinterpreting a 1990 cabinet decision intended to return land seized by the former Panchayat regime.</li><li><strong>2010:</strong> The cabinet led by Prime Minister <strong>Madhav Kumar Nepal</strong>, with <strong>Vijay Kumar Gachhadar</strong> as Minister for Physical Infrastructure, made decisions to expand the Prime Minister's residence. These decisions involved compensating individuals who had illegally occupied parts of the Lalita Niwas land, thereby legitimizing their fraudulent claims.</li><li><strong>2012:</strong> The cabinet led by Prime Minister <strong>Baburam Bhattarai</strong> gave approval to register government land from the complex under the name of a non-existent entity, the 'Pashupati Tikinchha Guthi'.</li></ul><p>Investigations by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police followed a probe committee report led by former secretary Sharada Prasad Trital. The CIAA filed a corruption case against 175 individuals in 2020, and the District Attorney's Office filed a separate forgery case against 310 individuals in 2023. The case has seen arrests of prominent figures, investigations into former Prime Ministers, and a partial acquittal of four former ministers by the Special Court in February 2024.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is from news reports and public discourse but has not been definitively confirmed by official investigation or court records:</p><ul><li>Some members of the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led cabinet have reportedly claimed that the proposals concerning Lalita Niwas were never formally discussed during meetings, suggesting the decision might have been pushed through by the Prime Minister without full cabinet deliberation.</li><li>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) chose not to indict then-NCP General Secretary Bishnu Prasad Paudel and Supreme Court Justice Kumar Regmi, who had purchased plots of the land. The CIAA's reasoning was that they had pledged to return the illegally acquired property to the state.</li><li>The exact origin of the name 'Lalita Niwas' is a matter of historical anecdote, widely believed to be named after the mother of Subarna Shamsher Rana, but this is not officially documented in the case files.</li></ul>",
