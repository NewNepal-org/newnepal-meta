### Case: Lalita Niwas Land Grab Scam

**ID:** `LALITA-NIWAS-2075`

**Status:** `Under Investigation / Partially Adjudicated`

**Date of Incident:** `1992-01-01` (Beginning of embezzlement period, 2049 BS)

**Case Summary:**
The Lalita Niwas land grab scam involves the illegal transfer of large swathes of government-owned land in the prime area of Baluwatar, Kathmandu, to private individuals, business groups, and land brokers. The land, part of a complex housing the Prime Minister's official residence and the Nepal Rastra Bank's central office, was systematically and collusively transferred over several decades. The scam was orchestrated through the forgery of government documents and manipulation of policy decisions by a nexus of land revenue officials, brokers, businesspersons, and high-level political figures, including cabinet ministers and former prime ministers. Investigations were launched by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police, leading to charges against hundreds of individuals.

**Description:**
<p>The Lalita Niwas land grab is a major corruption scandal in Nepal involving the illegal privatization of approximately 143 ropanis of government land in Baluwatar, Kathmandu. This land was part of a larger 300-ropani complex originally acquired by Prime Minister Bhim Shumsher J.B. Rana in the 1920s for his grandson, Subarna Shamsher Rana. Following the 1960 royal coup, the government seized 14 ropanis from Subarna Shamsher, a leader of the Nepali Congress party, and legally acquired another 284 ropanis with compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, 1961.</p>

<p>The scam began to unfold after the restoration of democracy in 1990. A 1990 cabinet decision by the Krishna Prasad Bhattarai government to return land seized by the previous regime was allegedly misinterpreted by land revenue officials. This led to the fraudulent return of not only the seized land but also the land that the government had legally acquired and paid compensation for. The embezzlement is reported to have occurred between 2049 BS and 2069 BS (approx. 1992 to 2012 AD).</p>

<p><strong>Key phases of the scam include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1992:</strong> Officials at the Dillibazar Land Revenue Office returned 113 ropanis and 3 annas of land to the heirs of Subarna Shamsher, a move which investigators later deemed illegal.</li>
    <li><strong>2010:</strong> The cabinet led by Prime Minister <strong>Madhav Kumar Nepal</strong>, with <strong>Vijay Kumar Gachhadar</strong> as Minister for Physical Infrastructure, made decisions to expand the Prime Minister's residence and build a road. These decisions involved "compensating" individuals who had illegally occupied parts of the Lalita Niwas land, thereby legitimizing their fraudulent claims.</li>
    <li><strong>2012:</strong> The cabinet led by Prime Minister <strong>Baburam Bhattarai</strong> gave in-principle approval to register government land from the complex in the name of a non-existent entity called the "Pashupati Tikinchha Guthi".</li>
</ul>

<p>Investigations identified land brokers <strong>Shobhakanta Dhakal</strong> and <strong>Ram Kumar Subedi</strong>, along with Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner <strong>Min Bahadur Gurung</strong>, as central figures in the scheme. They allegedly colluded with officials to create fake documents, bribe officials with plots of land, and sell the illegally acquired land to politicians and business houses, including the Goyal, Sarda, Chachan, and Kedia groups. A probe committee led by former secretary Sharada Prasad Trital, formed in 2018, unearthed the details of the conspiracy, leading to wider investigations.</p>

<p>On February 5, 2020, the CIAA filed a corruption case against 175 individuals, including former Deputy Prime Minister Gachhadar and three other former ministers. However, it spared former Prime Ministers Nepal and Bhattarai, citing that their actions were "policy decisions" outside the CIAA's jurisdiction. Following a Supreme Court order on August 6, 2023, the CIB initiated an investigation into the policy-level decision-makers, including Nepal and Bhattarai, and subsequently recorded their statements. On August 27, 2023, the Kathmandu District Attorney's Office filed a separate case for forgery against 310 individuals. On February 15, 2024, the Special Court acquitted four former ministers, including Vijay Kumar Gachhadar, in the corruption case filed by the CIAA.</p>
