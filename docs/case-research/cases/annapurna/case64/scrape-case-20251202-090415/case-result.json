  "title": "Encroachment and Misappropriation of Cotton Development Board Land",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the large-scale and persistent encroachment of land belonging to the Cotton Development Board (CDB), a state-owned entity established in 1980. The primary incident began around 2001-2002, during the CPN (Maoist) insurgency, when approximately <strong>825 bigha (550 hectares)</strong> of the Board's Kumbher farm land in Bardiya district were captured by Maoist cadres and subsequently occupied by landless individuals and freed bonded laborers.</p><p>The situation is complicated by several factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of Formal Title:</strong> The government allocated the land to the CDB in 1980 but never transferred the formal ownership certificate (lalpurja), weakening the Board's legal claim to the property.</li><li><strong>Government-Sanctioned Settlement:</strong> The Government of Nepal later formalized the settlement of 555 families of freed bonded laborers on 138 bigha and 15 kaththa of the encroached land.</li><li><strong>Destruction of Assets:</strong> During the insurgency, the CDB's head office in Khajura, Banke, was bombed and set on fire by then-rebel CPN (Maoist) forces, resulting in an estimated loss of <strong>NPR 5.93 crore</strong>.</li><li><strong>Ongoing Encroachment Attempts:</strong> Other CDB properties remain under threat. In 2023, a 3-bigha plot in Madhuwan, Bardiya, saw encroachment attempts by a group named the 'Nepal Shuddha Landless Independent Party'. Madhuwan Municipality was also implicated for demolishing the plot's fencing to build a road without the CDB's consent.</li></ul><p>The CDB, once a profitable enterprise, has been crippled by the loss of its primary land assets and the decline of the domestic textile industry. In its 2023 budget, the government announced its decision to dissolve the Board, creating further uncertainty about the future of its remaining and encroached lands.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p><ul><li>The exact date of the bombing and arson attack on the Cotton Development Board's headquarters in Khajura, Banke, is unknown, though sources confirm it occurred during the Maoist insurgency (1996-2006).</li><li>Some early reports mentioned a loss of '700 bigha,' which may be an approximation or refer to a specific portion of the total 825 bigha encroached at the Kumbher farm.</li><li>One source mentions a total of 1,320 bigha of CDB land across several districts that lacks official ownership certificates. This figure is higher than the 825 bigha repeatedly cited for the Kumbher farm and may represent the total land holdings of the Board, but this requires further verification.</li></ul></p>",
