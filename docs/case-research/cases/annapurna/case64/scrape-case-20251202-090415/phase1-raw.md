Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the land encroachment case of the Cotton Development Board.

***

### **Case Details**

*   **Case ID:** 64
*   **Case Title:** Encroachment of Cotton Development Board Land
*   **Date of Incident:** Starting from 2058 BS (2001-2002)
*   **Status:** Ongoing

### **Summary**

<p>In the year 2058 BS (2001-2002), during the peak of the CPN (Maoist) insurgency, cadres and supporters of the party initiated the capture and distribution of land belonging to the Cotton Development Board (कपास विकास समिति). The most significant encroachment occurred at the Kumbher farm in Bardiya district, where approximately 825 bigha (550 hectares) of land designated for cotton farming were taken over. The land was subsequently occupied by landless individuals (sukumbasi) and freed bonded laborers (mukta kamaiya). The issue is complicated by the fact that the government, while allocating the land to the Board in 1980, never provided the formal ownership certificate (lalpurja), weakening the Board's legal claim to reclaim the property. Over the years, the government itself has formalized the settlement of some freed bonded laborers on a portion of this land. The remaining areas continue to be occupied and used for private farming, with periodic new encroachment attempts on other Board properties in Bardiya, allegedly with the involvement of local political actors.</p>

<p>The main office of the Cotton Development Board in Khajura, Banke, was also attacked during the conflict, with Maoist rebels bombing and setting fire to the facility, causing an estimated loss of Rs 5.93 crore. The Board, once a profitable entity, has been severely hampered by the loss of its land and the closure of major domestic textile industries that it supplied. The government's 2023 announcement to dissolve the Board has added to the uncertainty surrounding the future of its remaining assets and the encroached lands.</p>

### **Timeline of Events**

*   **2037 BS (1980 AD):** The Government of Nepal establishes the Cotton Development Board (CDC) to promote cotton farming and supply domestic industries. It clears 1,200 hectares of forest to provide 550 hectares (approx. 825 bigha) of land in Kumbher, Bardiya, for the Board's use, though the official title deed (lalpurja) is not transferred to the CDC.
*   **2046-2060 BS (1989-2003 AD):** The Cotton Development Board operates profitably.
*   **2058 BS (2001-2002 AD):** During the Maoist insurgency, large-scale encroachment begins on the CDC's land in Bardiya. Approximately 825 bigha at the Kumbher farm are captured and distributed to landless people and squatters by Maoist cadres.
*   **Sometime during the conflict:** The CDC's head office in Khajura, Banke, is bombed and set on fire by then-rebel CPN (Maoist), causing damages worth approximately Rs 5.93 crore.
*   **Until 2060 BS (2003 AD):** Some locals who had encroached upon the land reportedly paid revenue to the government for its use.
*   **2064 BS (2007 AD):** Following the end of the conflict, the Armed Police Force (APF) is stationed at a 3-bigha CDC property in Madhuwan, Bardiya, which had also been captured by Maoists, to clear the encroachment.
*   **Date Unspecified:** The Government of Nepal formally distributes 138 bigha and 15 kaththa of the encroached Kumbher farm land to 555 families of freed bonded laborers (mukta kamaiya).
*   **Approx. 2018-2021 AD (4-5 years before recent articles):** The APF camp on the Madhuwan property is relocated, leaving the land vacant and vulnerable to re-encroachment.
*   **June 2025 (Asar, last fiscal year per articles):** Madhuwan Municipality demolishes the wire fence and fells 27 trees on the CDC's 3-bigha plot in Durgapur, citing the need to build a road, without coordinating with the CDC. The District Administration Office halts the activity after the CDC protests.
*   **October 31, 2025 (Kartik 16):** Over 150 people under the banner of the 'Nepal Shuddha Landless Independent Party' arrive from Bardiya, Dailekh, Jajarkot, and other districts to occupy the same Madhuwan plot by building makeshift shelters overnight.

### **Unverified Information**

*   The initial document provided mentioned a loss of "700 bigha," while multiple media sources consistently report the main encroached area as 825 bigha (550 hectares). The 700 bigha figure may be an approximation or refer to a subset of the total encroached land.
*   One source mentions a total of 1,320 bigha of CDC land across several districts that lacks official ownership certificates (lalpurja). This figure is higher than the 825 bigha repeatedly cited for the Kumbher farm and may represent the total holdings, but this requires further verification.
