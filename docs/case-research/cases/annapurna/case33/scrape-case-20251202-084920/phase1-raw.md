### **Description**

<p>The case involves severe negligence and prolonged delays in the expansion and improvement of the approximately 9-kilometer Kalanki-Nagdhunga road, a primary gateway into Kathmandu Valley. The contract was awarded in <strong>June/July 2015</strong> to joint ventures led by Shailung Construction, owned by Sharada Prasad Adhikari, with a total contract value of around <strong>NPR 1.138 billion</strong>. The project was divided into multiple packages, with original completion deadlines set for October 2017 to January 2018.</p>
<p>The construction work remained largely incomplete for years past the deadline, with only about 50% progress reported by late 2018. This led to immense public suffering, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Severe dust pollution</strong>, causing respiratory and other health issues for residents and commuters.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic disruption</strong> for local businesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Chronic traffic congestion</strong> on a critical national highway.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allegations were widespread that Shailung Construction and its owner, Sharada Prasad Adhikari, evaded legal action and accountability due to strong political connections, particularly his status as the landlord for the then co-chairman of the ruling party, Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Despite numerous warnings from government officials and public protests, the project saw minimal progress for an extended period. The contractor often cited compensation disputes for land acquisition as a reason for the delay, but even after those issues were addressed, the work did not accelerate as expected.</p>
<p>Following years of delays and failed promises, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) blacklisted Shailung Construction in August 2022 for three years due to its poor performance across multiple projects.</p>
