  "title": "Negligence and Delay in Nagdhunga-Kalanki Road Construction",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the <strong>severe negligence and prolonged delays</strong> in the expansion of the critical 9-kilometer Kalanki-Nagdhunga road section, a primary entryway into Kathmandu Valley. The project was awarded in June 2015 to joint ventures led by <strong>Shailung Construction Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, owned by Sharada Prasad Adhikari, with a total contract value of approximately NPR 1.138 billion.</p><p>Despite original completion deadlines between October 2017 and January 2018, the project languished for years, with progress reported at only around 50% by late 2018. This failure resulted in immense public hardship, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Severe dust pollution</strong>, leading to widespread respiratory and other health problems for residents and commuters.</li><li><strong>Chronic traffic congestion</strong> on a vital national highway, causing significant economic and social disruption.</li><li><strong>Economic losses</strong> for local businesses along the road corridor.</li></ul><p>Widespread allegations suggested that Shailung Construction evaded accountability due to the owner's strong political connections, notably his relationship as the landlord to Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was the co-chairman of the then-ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP). Despite multiple directives from government officials, including then-Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth, and public protests, the work progressed at a glacial pace. The contractor frequently cited delays in land acquisition compensation, but failed to accelerate work even after these issues were resolved.</p><p>Following years of missed deadlines and public outcry, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) <strong>blacklisted Shailung Construction Pvt. Ltd. for three years</strong> on August 24, 2022, due to its consistent failure to execute projects as per contracts.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is widely reported or alleged but lacks direct, official verification:</p><ul><li>The exact financial loss to the state or damages incurred by private citizens due to the extensive delays has not been officially quantified in the available documents.</li><li>While political protection was strongly implied in numerous media reports, there is no direct documentary evidence, such as official memos or court testimony, proving that Pushpa Kamal Dahal intervened to protect Sharada Prasad Adhikari or Shailung Construction from legal consequences.</li></ul>",
