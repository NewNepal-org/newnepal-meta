### Sudhir Basnet Cooperative Fraud Case: Raw Findings

#### **1. Case Overview**

**Case Name:** Oriental Cooperative and Associated Entities Fraud
**Primary Entity:** Oriental Co-operative Limited
**Lead Defendant:** Sudhir Basnet
**Case Type:** Cooperative Fraud, Embezzlement, Banking Offence

**Description:**
<p>The Oriental Cooperative fraud case, led by its chairman Sudhir Basnet, represents one of Nepal's largest financial scandals. Beginning around 2013, the case involves the misappropriation of billions of rupees from thousands of cooperative depositors and individuals who had made advance payments for apartments in Basnet's numerous real estate projects. Basnet funneled these funds into a vast network of businesses, primarily in the real estate sector, including about two dozen housing projects. His business empire began to unravel following a downturn in the real estate market and tightened lending from banks, leading to a liquidity crisis. This left Oriental Cooperative unable to refund its depositors and his construction companies unable to deliver on promised housing units.</p><p>The government declared Oriental Cooperative 'problematic' in 2017 and formed the Problematic Cooperatives Management Committee (PCMC) to manage and liquidate Basnet's assets to repay victims. Despite numerous arrests, court sentences, and the formation of multiple government committees over more than a decade, the majority of the victims have yet to recover their lost savings. The total liability has been estimated to be between <strong>NPR 16 to 17 billion</strong>. The case highlights significant regulatory failures in the cooperative sector and the prolonged struggle for justice for thousands of victims.</p>

**Allegations:**
<ul>
    <li>Misappropriating over NPR 16 billion from cooperative depositors, apartment buyers, and financial institutions.</li>
    <li>Illegally diverting funds from Oriental Cooperative to finance personal real estate ventures and other companies like Agni Air.</li>
    <li>Defrauding homebuyers by collecting advance payments for housing and apartment projects that were never completed.</li>
    <li>Issuing bouncing cheques.</li>
    <li>Defaulting on loans worth over NPR 1.6 billion from at least 14 different banks and financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
