  "title": "Oriental Cooperative and Sudhir Basnet Fraud Case",
  "description": "<p>The Oriental Cooperative fraud case, led by its chairman <strong>Sudhir Basnet</strong>, is one of Nepal's largest financial scandals, involving the misappropriation of billions of rupees from thousands of depositors and homebuyers. Starting around 2012, Basnet allegedly funneled funds from the cooperative and advance payments for apartments into a network of personal businesses, primarily in the real estate sector. A downturn in the real estate market led to a liquidity crisis, causing Oriental Cooperative to default on refunds and Basnet's construction companies to fail in delivering promised housing units.</p><p>The total liability is estimated to be between <strong>NPR 16.1 billion and NPR 17 billion</strong>, affecting over 7,600 depositors and numerous homebuyers. In response, the Government of Nepal declared Oriental Co-operative 'problematic' in 2017 and formed the <strong>Problematic Cooperatives Management Committee (PCMC)</strong> to liquidate Basnet's assets and repay victims. Despite numerous arrests, court sentences, and government interventions over more than a decade, the vast majority of victims have yet to recover their savings. The case highlights severe regulatory failures in Nepal's cooperative sector and the prolonged struggle for financial justice for thousands of citizens.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information consists of claims and suspicions that have been reported but not fully substantiated by official findings:</p><ul><li>Claims made by Sudhir Basnet during interrogations that his personal assets were worth NPR 12-14 billion against liabilities of NPR 8 billion, a figure that was not independently verified by the management committee at the time.</li><li>Suspicions held by the Problematic Cooperatives Management Committee (PCMC) that Basnet possesses numerous 'hidden' assets registered under the names of third parties. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) was reportedly asked to help identify these assets.</li><li>Allegations from victims that Sudhir Basnet, following his release from prison, attempted to initiate new schemes by soliciting more funds from them for land deals (such as the Meghouli land plot incident) with the promise of recovering their original losses.</li></ul>",
