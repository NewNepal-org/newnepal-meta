### Case ID: Prado-Pajero-Scandal-1995

---

#### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

<p>The "Prado-Pajero Scandal" (also known as 'Prado Kand') refers to a political controversy in Nepal that took place around 1994-1995. It is considered a significant "black spot" in the history of Nepal's newly-restored democracy. The core of the scandal involved a government decision to grant Members of Parliament (MPs) a facility to import vehicles with a substantial customs duty and sales tax exemption.</p>

<p>The government, led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, decided to provide a <strong>95% tax waiver</strong> for MPs to purchase personal vehicles. Following this decision, a large number of parliamentarians allegedly misused this privilege. An estimated <strong>80% of MPs</strong> reportedly did not purchase the vehicles for their own use. Instead, they sold their duty-free import facility to businessmen and smugglers for a profit. Many MPs did not have the personal funds, reportedly around Rs 5 million at the time, to purchase these expensive SUVs themselves and acted as intermediaries.</p>

<p>This act of selling the tax exemption was seen as a major abuse of power and a form of corruption that undermined public trust in democratic institutions. The state incurred a significant loss of revenue, with some sources claiming it amounted to "billions" of rupees. The scandal was widely seen as an attempt by the politically unstable coalition government to secure the loyalty of MPs. Due to the widespread misuse and public outcry, the facility was later discontinued.</p>

#### **Quotes and Specific Details**

*   "If there is a black spot in Nepali politics it is the 'Pajero Scandal' of 1994. Elected members of the parliament in Nepal's newly-restored democracy at that time forgot about serving the people and granted themselves the facility to import duty-free SUVs." - Nepali Times.
*   An Onlinekhabar article, recounting the period, states: "To keep his government afloat, Deuba introduced a plan to give MPs a discount on customs duty for vehicle purchases. This incident, famous as the 'Prado Kand', made the parliament and MPs the most infamous in Nepali history. MPs started trading in vehicles obtained with customs exemption. At that time, 80 percent of the MPs bought and sold vehicles with customs exemption." (Translated from Nepali).
*   "After the then Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government decided to waive 95 percent tax for MPs in 1994, most of the lawmakers had misused the facility to buy luxurious Pajero jeeps for businessmen." - myRepublica.
