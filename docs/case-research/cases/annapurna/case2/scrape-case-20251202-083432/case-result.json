  "description": "<p>The Prado-Pajero Scandal, also known as 'Prado Kand', refers to a major political controversy in Nepal during 1994-1995. The scandal centered on a decision by the coalition government, led by then-Prime Minister <strong>Sher Bahadur Deuba</strong>, to grant Members of Parliament (MPs) a facility to import vehicles with a <strong>95% customs duty and sales tax exemption</strong>.</p><p>This privilege was allegedly widely abused. Instead of purchasing vehicles for personal use, an estimated <strong>80% of MPs</strong> reportedly sold their duty-free import permits to businessmen and smugglers for personal profit. Many MPs lacked the personal funds, estimated at around Rs 5 million at the time, to purchase the expensive SUVs themselves and effectively acted as intermediaries. This act was seen as a gross abuse of power and a method for the politically unstable government to secure the loyalty of parliamentarians.</p><p>The key consequences of the scandal were:</p><ul><li>A significant loss of state revenue, with some sources claiming it amounted to billions of rupees.</li><li>Widespread public condemnation and a significant erosion of public trust in the newly restored democratic institutions.</li><li>The incident is often cited as a 'black spot' in Nepal's political history.</li></ul><p>Due to the public outcry and the scale of the misuse, the vehicle exemption facility was later discontinued. The scandal remains a prominent example of policy corruption in Nepal.
