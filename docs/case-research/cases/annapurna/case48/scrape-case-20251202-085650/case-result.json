  "title": "Fertilizer Contract Default by Shailung Enterprises and Honiko Multiple (2020)",
  "description": "<p>In 2020, two private contractors, <strong>Shailung Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.</strong> and <strong>Honiko Multiple Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, defaulted on agreements to supply a total of 50,000 metric tons of urea fertilizer. This failure led to a severe nationwide fertilizer shortage during the peak paddy plantation season, significantly impacting farmers and threatening national food security.</p><p>The state-owned <strong>Krishi Samagri Company Limited (KSCL)</strong>, also known as Agriculture Inputs Company Limited (AICL), had awarded the contracts to address the country's agricultural needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Shailung Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, owned by Sharada Prasad Adhikari, signed a contract on <strong>April 20, 2020</strong>, to import 25,000 metric tons of urea.</li><li><strong>Honiko Multiple Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, owned by Homnath Koirala, signed a contract on <strong>April 27, 2020</strong>, for an additional 25,000 metric tons of urea.</li></ul><p>Both companies failed to deliver the fertilizers by the initial deadline of July 23, 2020, and a subsequent extended deadline of September 5, 2020. According to reports, the companies could not provide any details about the shipment or transport vessels when questioned by AICL.</p><p>As a result of the default, the government took decisive action. On or around <strong>September 7, 2020</strong>, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development announced the termination of both contracts. The government also seized the performance guarantee deposits from both companies, totaling over NPR 90 million (approximately NPR 48 million from each). AICL initiated proceedings to blacklist the firms and seek further compensation for damages.</p><p>The case drew significant public attention due to the alleged political connections of the contractors. Sharada Prasad Adhikari is widely known as the landlord of Pushpa Kamal Dahal, chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), leading to allegations that political influence was used to secure the contract despite a poor track record. This incident highlighted systemic issues in Nepal's public procurement process and its dependency on imports for critical agricultural inputs, a problem that <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/opinion/2022/08/17/nepal-s-fertilizer-crisis-a-symptom-of-a-broken-agricultural-supply-chain\">chronically affects the nation's farmers</a>.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Some internal case files reportedly list the year of the incident as <strong>2078 BS</strong>, which conflicts with verifiable news reports and official announcements from <strong>2020 AD (2077 BS)</strong>.</p><p>While Sharada Prasad Adhikari's connection to Pushpa Kamal Dahal is widely reported, the political affiliation of Homnath Koirala of Honiko Multiple with the Nepali Congress party is mentioned in some reports but is less frequently substantiated.</p><p>Some sources state the contract for Shailung Enterprises was signed on April 24, 2020, while others state April 20, 2020. The latter is used in the main record as it appears in more detailed reports.</p>",
