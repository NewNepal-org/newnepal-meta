### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

#### **The Contracts**

*   The Agriculture Inputs Company Limited (AICL) awarded contracts to Shailung Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. and Honiko Multiple Pvt. Ltd. to supply chemical fertilizers for the rainy season.
*   **Shailung Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.:** Signed an agreement on **April 20, 2020,** to import **25,000 metric tons of urea**. Some sources cite the date as April 24, 2020. Shailung was expected to source the fertilizer from Russia or Oman.
*   **Honiko Multiple Pvt. Ltd.:** Signed an agreement on **April 27, 2020,** to import **25,000 metric tons of urea**. Honiko planned to import from China.
*   Both companies were selected to supply fertilizer for the paddy production season.

#### **The Default**

*   A letter of credit was opened for both companies on **May 12, 2020**.
*   According to the agreements, the first consignment was due within 42 days, and the second within 72 days from the date the letter of credit was issued. The initial deadline for import was **July 23, 2020**.
*   Both companies failed to meet the original deadlines.
*   The government subsequently granted a 25-day deadline extension, pushing the final delivery date to **September 5, 2020**.
*   Despite the extension, the companies failed to import the fertilizers and could not provide any details about shipment or transport vessels when questioned by AICL.
*   This failure to supply led to an acute shortage of chemical fertilizers across Nepal during the peak season for paddy farming, threatening to reduce crop production.

#### **Government Action and Consequences**

*   On **September 6 or 7, 2020**, the Agriculture Inputs Company Limited (AICL) officially terminated the contracts with both Shailung Enterprises and Honiko Multiple.
*   The government confiscated the performance guarantee deposits of both companies. Each company had deposited **NPR 48 million**, for a total of over NPR 90 million seized.
*   AICL also initiated action to blacklist the companies and sought to recover further compensation for the damages caused by the default.
*   Then-Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development, Ghanashyam Bhusal, confirmed the contract termination and deposit seizure, stating the companies were "careless despite having adequate time."

#### **Associated Individuals and Political Connections**

*   **Sharada Prasad Adhikari:** The owner of Shailung Enterprises, he is widely identified as the landlord of Pushpa Kamal Dahal, chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center) and former Prime Minister. Sources allege that Adhikari used his political influence to secure contracts.
*   **Homnath Koirala:** The proprietor of Honiko Multiple Pvt. Ltd., reported to be a contractor with affiliations to the Nepali Congress party.

#### **Context of Fertilizer Shortages in Nepal**

*   Nepal faces a chronic shortage of chemical fertilizers, a problem that recurs annually during peak farming seasons. The country is entirely dependent on imports, primarily from India and China, and lacks its own production facilities.
*   The state-owned entities AICL and Salt Trading Corporation (STC) are responsible for importing approximately 600,000 tons of fertilizer annually under a government subsidy program.
*   Systemic issues include delayed tenders, logistical bottlenecks, unpredictable export policies from neighboring countries, and a thriving black market for smuggled, often low-quality, fertilizers.
*   The failure of contractors like Shailung and Honiko exacerbates this pre-existing crisis, directly impacting farmers and national food security.
