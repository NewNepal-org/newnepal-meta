  "title": "Budhigandaki Hydropower Project: Allegation of 9 Billion NPR Corruption",
  "description": "<p>The case concerns a public allegation of corruption made on October 8, 2020, by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, a former Prime Minister of Nepal. During a speech in Gorkha, Dr. Bhattarai accused three top political leaders of embezzling 9 billion Nepalese Rupees in commission from the 1200 MW Budhigandaki Hydropower Project.</p><p>The leaders he named were:</p><ul><li><strong>KP Sharma Oli</strong> (then Prime Minister)</li><li><strong>Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'</strong> (former Prime Minister)</li><li><strong>Sher Bahadur Deuba</strong> (former Prime Minister)</li></ul><p>The allegation drew significant public and media attention, particularly because the Budhigandaki project's contract had a controversial history. The contract was first awarded to the China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) by a government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, subsequently scrapped by a government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba, and then reinstated by a government led by KP Sharma Oli.</p><p>All three accused leaders and their respective political parties, the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and the Nepali Congress (NC), vehemently denied the claims. They challenged Dr. Bhattarai to provide evidence to state authorities like the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and demanded an apology.</p><p>Following these challenges, Dr. Bhattarai did not present any evidence. Instead, he called for a high-level independent committee to investigate the project. At a later event, he clarified that his initial statement was based on <strong>'unconfirmed information'</strong> (अपुष्ट सूचना) and was meant to criticize the project being awarded to a foreign company. Despite the seriousness of the initial charge, the CIAA never launched a formal investigation into the matter.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The central claim of this case—that <strong>9 billion NPR was taken as a commission</strong> by KP Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and Sher Bahadur Deuba—remains entirely unverified.</p><ul><li>The allegation was made publicly by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai without any supporting evidence being presented.</li><li>Dr. Bhattarai later retracted his statement, admitting it was based on <strong>'unconfirmed information'</strong>.</li><li>There has been no formal investigation by the CIAA or any other state body to substantiate or disprove the claim. The CIAA's official records show no investigation into this specific allegation.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the entire allegation of a 9 billion NPR corruption scandal is considered unsubstantiated and was effectively withdrawn by the accuser.</p>",
