### Description

<p>The case revolves around a public accusation of corruption made in October 2020 by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, a former Prime Minister of Nepal. During a political program in his home constituency of Gorkha on October 8, 2020, Dr. Bhattarai alleged that three of the country's top political leaders had embezzled 9 billion Nepalese Rupees in commission related to the 1200 MW Budhigandaki Hydropower Project.</p>

<p>The leaders he explicitly named were:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>KP Sharma Oli</strong> (then Prime Minister)</li>
    <li><strong>Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'</strong> (former Prime Minister and Co-chair of the Nepal Communist Party)</li>
    <li><strong>Sher Bahadur Deuba</strong> (former Prime Minister and President of the Nepali Congress)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. Bhattarai claimed he had evidence to prove his assertion. The allegation gained significant media attention due to the high profiles of those accused and the history of the Budhigandaki project, which had been a point of contention. The project's contract had been awarded to the China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC), revoked, and then reinstated by successive governments led by the very leaders Dr. Bhattarai accused.</p>

<p>The accused leaders and their respective parties vehemently denied the allegations. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli termed the statement "irresponsible and baseless". Both the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and the Nepali Congress (NC) issued official statements challenging Dr. Bhattarai to present his evidence to the public and to the competent state authorities, such as the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), and demanded an apology.</p>

<p>In response to these challenges, Dr. Bhattarai did not publicly produce any evidence. Instead, he shifted his stance, calling for the formation of a high-level, independent "citizen ombudsman committee" to investigate the Budhigandaki project and other major corruption scandals, promising his full cooperation.</p>

<p>Subsequently, at a later political event, Dr. Bhattarai walked back his claim. He stated that his original accusation was based on <strong>"unconfirmed information"</strong> (अपुष्ट सूचना) and was made in the context of criticising the decision to award the project to a foreign company instead of developing it with Nepal's internal resources. He clarified that since the government had decided that Nepal would build the project itself, the issue was now "corrected."</p>

<p>Despite the gravity of the initial accusation, the CIAA did not launch a formal investigation into the alleged 9 billion NPR commission. The case remains a high-profile example of a public corruption allegation that was unsubstantiated and later retracted by the accuser.</p>

### Unverified Info

<p>The central claim of this case—that <strong>9 billion NPR was taken as a commission</strong> by KP Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and Sher Bahadur Deuba—is itself unverified.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The allegation was made by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai without presenting any public evidence.</li>
    <li>Dr. Bhattarai later admitted that his statement was based on <strong>"unconfirmed information"</strong>.</li>
    <li>There has been no official investigation by the CIAA or any other state body to substantiate or disprove the claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the entire allegation of a 9 billion NPR corruption scandal in the Budhigandaki project remains unsubstantiated and was effectively retracted by the original accuser.</p>
