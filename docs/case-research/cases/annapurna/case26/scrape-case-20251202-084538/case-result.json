The arrested individuals were Chief Tax Officer <strong>Lal Bahadur Khatri</strong> and a non-gazetted first-class officer (Nayab Subba) <strong>Suresh Kumar Singh</strong>.</p><p>According to the CIAA, Khatri and Singh demanded and accepted a bribe of <strong>NPR 150,000</strong> from a service seeker. The bribe was allegedly solicited to settle the service seeker's tax liability. Following a complaint, a team from the CIAA's Bardibas office conducted a sting operation.</p><p>On February 12, 2023, the CIAA team caught the two officials red-handed with the bribe money at their office. They were taken into custody for further investigation into the corruption charges. The case highlights ongoing issues of bribery and abuse of authority within government service delivery offices.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The specific details of the tax liability that was to be 'settled' in exchange for the bribe have not been publicly disclosed by the authorities. The identity of the service-seeker who filed the complaint has also been kept confidential, which is standard procedure in such cases to protect the informant.</p>",
