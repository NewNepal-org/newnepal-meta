  "title": "Giribandhu Tea Estate Land Swap Scandal",
  "description": "<p>The Giribandhu Tea Estate case is a prominent alleged instance of <strong>'policy corruption'</strong> involving an attempt to swap approximately <strong>343 bighas (232 hectares)</strong> of valuable land in Birtamod, Jhapa, for less valuable land elsewhere. The estate's land was granted an exemption from the national land ceiling under the <strong>Land Reform Act of 1964</strong>, on the strict condition that it be used exclusively for tea cultivation. Any change in use would mean the land reverts to government ownership.</p><p>The core allegation is that the government led by then-Prime Minister <strong>K.P. Sharma Oli</strong> deliberately amended the Land Act in 2020 to create a legal loophole. This Eighth Amendment introduced a provision allowing land held under ceiling exemptions to be swapped or relocated. Critics argue this amendment was tailor-made to benefit Giribandhu Tea Estate's owners and associated business interests, who sought to convert the prime agricultural land into a commercial real estate venture, potentially worth billions of rupees.</p><p>Following the amendment, the Oli-led cabinet on <strong>April 26, 2021</strong>, officially approved the land swap. This decision was immediately challenged in court by Advocate Om Prakash Aryal and others.</p><p>The case culminated in a landmark decision by the Supreme Court. On <strong>February 7, 2024</strong>, a Constitutional Bench of the court annulled the cabinet's decision, calling it 'immature', 'illogical', and contrary to the spirit of the Land Act. In its full verdict released on <strong>May 12, 2024</strong>, the court not only invalidated the swap but also ordered that any part of the estate's land found to be unused for tea production must be confiscated by the government. This verdict set a strong precedent against using policy changes for private gain.</p>",
