### **2. Information from Public Domain Research (The Land Swap Scandal)**

The predominant and publicly documented case concerning Giribandhu Tea Estate is a long-running, multi-billion rupee scandal involving allegations of "policy corruption" aimed at swapping valuable land for commercial real estate development.

#### **A. Key Facts and Allegations**

*   **Core Allegation:** The government, particularly the administration led by K.P. Sharma Oli, is accused of illegally attempting to facilitate the swap of valuable Giribandhu Tea Estate land in Birtamod, Jhapa, for less valuable land elsewhere in Koshi Province. This was allegedly done to allow the estate's owners and associated business interests to convert the legally protected agricultural land into commercial real estate for massive profit.
*   **"Policy Corruption":** The scandal is frequently cited as a prime example of "policy corruption," where laws are specifically amended to benefit a select interest group. The Eighth Amendment to the Land Act in 2020 is seen as the key legal change that was allegedly tailored to enable this land swap.
*   **Land in Question:** The case revolves around approximately **343 bighas, 19 kathas, and 12 dhurs** (approx. 232 hectares) of land held by the tea estate in Birtamod, Jhapa, under a land ceiling exemption. The land's value is estimated to be in the billions of rupees.
*   **Legal Exemption:** The Land Reform Act of 1964 (2021 BS) imposed a ceiling on land ownership. However, it granted exemptions for industrial or agricultural purposes. Giribandhu Tea Estate was granted an exemption for its land on the condition that it be used solely for tea cultivation and could not be sold or transferred for other purposes. If the land is not used for its specified purpose, it is supposed to revert to government ownership.
*   **Supreme Court Intervention:** The Supreme Court of Nepal has been central to the case.
    *   In August 2021, the court issued an interim order barring the implementation of the government's land swap decision.
    *   On **February 7, 2024**, a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court definitively annulled the K.P. Sharma Oli government's cabinet decision of April 26, 2021, which had authorized the land swap.
    *   The court ruled the cabinet's decision was "immature," "illogical," and contravened the Land Act of 1964.
    *   In a full verdict released on **May 12, 2024**, the court set strict criteria for any future land swaps by commercial entities and ordered that any land held by Giribandhu Tea Estate found to be unused for tea production be confiscated and brought under government ownership.

#### **B. Key Individuals and Entities**
