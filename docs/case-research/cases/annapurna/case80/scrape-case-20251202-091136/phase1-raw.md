### Description

<p>Surendra Bahadur Thapa, a Joint Attorney at the High Government Prosecutor's Office in Pokhara, was arrested on charges of accepting a bribe. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) apprehended him in a sting operation after receiving a tip-off from a service seeker. Thapa had allegedly demanded a bribe of <strong>NPR 500,000</strong> to refrain from pursuing a case at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The case involved the son of a service seeker from Kapilvastu, who had been convicted in a fraud case related to a recruiting company 15 years prior. The Kaski District Court had initially sentenced the son to two years in prison and a fine of NPR 620,000. However, the Pokhara High Court later amended the verdict, removing the prison sentence while upholding the fine. Thapa demanded the bribe to prevent filing an appeal against the High Court's decision at the Supreme Court, which could have potentially reinstated the prison sentence.</p>
<p>Based on the service seeker's complaint, a CIAA team from the Pokhara regional office arrested Thapa with the bribe money from his government quarters. Reports indicate that upon realizing he was being raided by the CIAA, Thapa attempted to dispose of the evidence by throwing the cash out of his room. Following the arrest, the CIAA filed a formal corruption case against Thapa at the Special Court in Kathmandu.</p>
