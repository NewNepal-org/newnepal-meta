  "title": "Bribery Case Against Joint Attorney Surendra Bahadur Thapa",
  "description": "<p>Surendra Bahadur Thapa, a Joint Attorney at the High Government Prosecutor's Office in Pokhara, was arrested for allegedly accepting a bribe of <strong>NPR 500,000</strong>. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) apprehended him in a sting operation on October 10, 2018, from his government quarters in Pokhara.</p><p>The bribe was allegedly demanded from a service seeker from Kapilvastu. Thapa promised not to file an appeal at the Supreme Court against a Pokhara High Court verdict concerning the service seeker's son. The son had been convicted in a fraud case from approximately 15 years prior. While the Kaski District Court had imposed a two-year prison sentence and a fine, the High Court later amended this to only a fine. Thapa demanded the payment to prevent the case from being escalated, which could have potentially reinstated the prison sentence.</p><p>Following a complaint from the service seeker, the CIAA's Pokhara office conducted the sting operation. Reports indicate that upon realizing he was being raided, Thapa attempted to throw the bribe money out of his room. On November 13, 2018, the CIAA formally filed a corruption case against Thapa at the Special Court in Kathmandu, seeking action under Section 3 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002.</p>",
