  "title": "Bharat Lake (Bharat Taal) Construction and Beautification Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The Bharat Lake (Bharat Taal) case involves multiple layers of corruption centered around the construction of a large artificial lake in Bagmati Municipality, Sarlahi, during the tenure of Mayor <strong>Bharat Kumar Thapa</strong>. Investigations by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the District Forest Office uncovered several significant illegal activities that occurred between the fiscal years 2018 and 2023.</p><p><strong>Key areas of corruption include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Illegal Excavation and Sale of Riverine Materials:</strong> Officials were accused of preparing a fraudulent environmental impact assessment to illegally excavate vast quantities of stones, gravel, and sand from the Bagmati riverbed. An estimated 1.34 million cubic meters of these materials were sold without proper records, leading to a financial loss to the state of <strong>NPR 302.93 million</strong>.</li><li><strong>Misuse of Government Grants:</strong> A separate case focuses on the misuse of federal and provincial grants amounting to <strong>NPR 567.17 million</strong>. This includes an NPR 300 million grant allegedly approved unilaterally on June 20, 2021, by former Madhesh Province Finance Minister <strong>Bijay Kumar Yadav</strong> without following the required procedures.</li><li><strong>Forest Land Encroachment:</strong> The entire lake project was constructed on 173 hectares of protected forest land belonging to the Sagarnath Forest Development Project. An additional 815.20 hectares were allegedly encroached upon for agriculture and settlement, totaling 988.20 hectares. The construction proceeded despite the forest project's formal refusal of consent on September 4, 2019. The District Forest Office claimed this caused a loss of <strong>NPR 1.49 billion</strong>.</li><li><strong>Illicit Wealth Accumulation:</strong> In a related case, Mayor Bharat Kumar Thapa was found guilty of amassing <strong>NPR 34.52 million</strong> in wealth disproportionate to his known legal sources of income.</li></ul><p>On August 6, 2024, the Special Court convicted Bharat Kumar Thapa, then-Chief Administrative Officer Bimal Kumar Pokharel, and Engineer Sagar Paudel in the lake construction case. On August 14, 2024, they were each sentenced to eight years in prison and fined NPR 100 million. Thapa received an additional one-year sentence in the separate illicit wealth case.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are suggestions that Bharat Thapa attempted to fabricate evidence to justify his wealth by filing cases in the Sarlahi District Court, claiming he had borrowed money and failed to repay it. The Special Court ultimately did not accept these claims as a legitimate source of income.</p><p>An initial loss amount of '45 Crore' (NPR 450 million) was mentioned in early reports. This figure does not precisely match the official amounts from the subsequent charge sheets (NPR 302.93 million and NPR 567.17 million) but may have been an early estimate or a rounded figure.</p>",
