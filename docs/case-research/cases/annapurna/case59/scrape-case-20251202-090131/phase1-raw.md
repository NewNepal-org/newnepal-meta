### **Description**

<p>The Bharat Lake (Bharat Taal) case involves multiple layers of corruption centered around the construction of an artificial lake in Bagmati Municipality, Sarlahi. The project was led by then-Mayor Bharat Kumar Thapa. Investigations by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the District Forest Office revealed several illegal activities.</p>
<p><strong>Key Allegations Include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Illegal Excavation and Sale of Riverine Materials:</strong> The primary charge involves the excavation of stones, gravel, and sand from the Bagmati riverbed far exceeding approved quantities. Officials allegedly prepared a fraudulent environmental report to facilitate this. Nearly 1.34 million cubic meters of these materials were reportedly sold without official records, causing a financial loss of <strong>NPR 302.93 million</strong> to the state.</li>
    <li><strong>Misuse of Government Grants:</strong> The CIAA filed a separate case against municipal officials and the former Finance Minister of Madhesh Province, Bijay Kumar Yadav. He is accused of unilaterally approving a grant of <strong>NPR 300 million</strong> on June 20, 2021, without following due process or receiving approval from the Council of Ministers. The total financial damage from the misuse of federal and provincial grants is estimated at <strong>NPR 567.17 million</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Forest Land Encroachment:</strong> The entire project was illegally constructed on protected forest land. A total of 988.20 hectares belonging to the Sagarnath Forest Development Project was encroached upon—173 hectares for the lake and an additional 815.20 hectares for agriculture and settlement. This was done despite the project's explicit refusal of consent in a letter dated September 4, 2019. The District Forest Office has claimed this caused a loss of <strong>NPR 1.49 billion</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Illicit Wealth Accumulation:</strong> In a related case, Mayor Bharat Kumar Thapa was found guilty of amassing wealth disproportionate to his legal income. The Special Court identified <strong>NPR 34.52 million</strong> as illegally acquired property.</li>
</ul>
<p>On August 6, 2025, the Special Court convicted Bharat Kumar Thapa, Chief Administrative Officer Bimal Kumar Pokharel, and Engineer Sagar Paudel in the lake construction case. On August 14, 2025, they were each sentenced to eight years in prison and a fine of NPR 100 million. Thapa received a separate one-year prison sentence for the illicit wealth conviction.</p>

### **Unverified Information**

*   <p>The initial information provided mentioned a loss of "45 Crore" (NPR 450 million). While this figure is in the range of the amounts claimed in different sub-cases (NPR 302 million and NPR 567 million), it does not precisely match any of the official figures from the charge sheets. It might have been an early estimate or a rounded figure.</p>
*   <p>There are suggestions that Bharat Thapa attempted to fabricate evidence to justify his wealth by filing cases in the Sarlahi District Court, claiming he had borrowed money and failed to repay it. The Special Court ultimately did not accept these claims as a legitimate source of income.</p>
