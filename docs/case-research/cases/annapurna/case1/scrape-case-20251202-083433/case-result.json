  "title": "Lauda Air Aircraft Lease Scandal",
  "description": "<p>The Lauda Air scandal involves significant allegations of corruption and procedural irregularities within the state-owned Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC), now Nepal Airlines Corporation, concerning the lease of a Boeing 767 aircraft from Austria's Lauda Air in 2000-2001. The core of the controversy was the decision to lease the aircraft through <strong>direct negotiation instead of a competitive global tender</strong>, which was contrary to directives from the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).</p><p>The CIAA subsequently investigated the deal and filed a corruption case on May 24, 2001, alleging embezzlement amounting to <strong>NPR 389.7 million</strong>. The accused included the then-Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Tarini Datta Chataut, RNAC's Executive Chairman Hari Bhakta Shrestha, and several board members and officials, as well as two officials from Lauda Air.</p><p>Key issues raised by investigators and critics included:</p><ul><li><strong>Procedural Bypass:</strong> The procurement process deliberately avoided a transparent, competitive bidding process, raising suspicions of foul play.</li><li><strong>Inflated Costs:</strong> The official lease rate of $3,350 per flying hour was allegedly a fraction of the real cost, which was believed to exceed $5,000 per hour when including hidden charges for spares, crew, and other services.</li><li><strong>Lack of Necessity:</strong> Critics, including RNAC's own employee unions, argued that the airline's existing fleet was underutilized and there was no operational or financial justification for leasing a fourth aircraft. The airline, reportedly profitable before the lease, began incurring heavy monthly losses afterward.</li><li><strong>Political Involvement:</strong> The scandal had major political repercussions, leading to the resignation of Tourism Minister Chataut and contributing to the resignation of then-Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, whose cabinet had approved the deal.</li></ul><p>On August 13, 2007, the Special Court acquitted all accused, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. The CIAA appealed this verdict at the Supreme Court. On May 25, 2018, a division bench of the Supreme Court delivered a split verdict, with one justice finding two former RNAC officials guilty and the other upholding the acquittal. Due to the split decision, the case was referred to a full bench, where it has remained pending for years, subject to numerous postponements.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are several unconfirmed details and conflicting reports related to the case:</p><ul><li><strong>Total Financial Loss:</strong> While the CIAA's official claim was for NPR 389.7 million, other estimates of the total loss to RNAC varied widely. One report cited a figure as high as <strong>NPR 2 billion</strong>, while another calculated the loss at approximately <strong>NPR 335 million</strong>. RNAC employees claimed the lease created an extra financial burden of nearly <strong>NPR 110 million per month</strong>.</li><li><strong>Alleged Commissions:</strong> Media reports at the time alleged that a commission of <strong>$400 per flying hour</strong> was built into the deal, which would have totaled approximately <strong>NPR 160 million</strong> over the 18-month lease term. This amount was purportedly to be divided among a 'political fund', the Lauda Air agent in Nepal, and RNAC officials.</li><li><strong>Aircraft Ownership:</strong> A PAC investigation reportedly found that the aircraft did not belong to Lauda Air but to a separate, unnamed Hong Kong-based company, a detail not mentioned in the lease agreement.</li><li><strong>Name Discrepancy:</strong> One of the accused, the RNAC Marketing Director, is referred to as both Ramraj Upadhyaya and Raja Ram Upadhyaya in different documents.</li></ul>",
