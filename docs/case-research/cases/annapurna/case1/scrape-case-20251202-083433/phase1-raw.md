### **Case Summary**

**Case Name:** Lauda Air Aircraft Lease Scandal (also known as Lauda Air Scam, लाउडा जहाज भाडा घोटाला)

**Synopsis:** The case involves allegations of major corruption and irregularities at the state-owned Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC), now Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), surrounding the 2000-2001 lease of a Boeing 767 aircraft from the Austrian company Lauda Air. Accusations centered on the decision to lease the aircraft through direct negotiations rather than a competitive tender, at an inflated cost, and despite the airline not having a clear need for a fourth plane. The scandal implicated high-level government officials, including the then-Prime Minister, and led to a long-running legal battle.

### **Key Facts and Allegations**

#### **The Lease Agreement**
*   **Aircraft:** A 12-to-13-year-old Boeing 767 aircraft from Lauda Air of Vienna, Austria.
*   **Lease Term:** 18 months.
*   **Decision Date:** The RNAC board decided to lease the aircraft on or around **October 3, 2000** (२०५७ असोज १७ गते).
*   **Procurement Method:** The lease was arranged through direct personal negotiation, bypassing a global tender process. This was done contrary to a directive from the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).

#### **Financial Irregularities**
*   **Alleged Corruption:** The CIAA filed a case alleging embezzlement amounting to **NPR 389.7 million** (approximately USD 5.11 million at the time).
*   **Alleged Loss to RNAC:** Initial estimates of the total loss varied. One report cited a figure of **NPR 2 billion**. Another calculated the loss at around **NPR 335 million**. RNAC employees stated the lease created an extra financial burden of nearly **NPR 110 million per month**.
*   **Inflated and Hidden Costs:**
    *   The official lease rate was stated as **$3,350 per flying hour**. However, with hidden costs for spares, landing fees, ground services, and crew, the effective rate was alleged to be over **$5,000 per hour**.
    *   An advance payment of **$1 million** was released to Lauda Air without confirmation from Austria, a move compelled by the government.
*   **Alleged Commissions:** Media at the time reported claims that officials and middlemen were set to make a commission of **$400 per flying hour**. Over the 18-month lease, this would have amounted to **NPR 160 million**, allegedly to be split between a "political fund," the Lauda Air agent in Nepal, RNAC officials, and other middlemen.

#### **Procedural and Operational Issues**
*   **Unnecessary Aircraft:** Critics, including RNAC employee unions, argued the airline did not need a fourth aircraft, as its existing two Boeing 757s were not operating at their maximum guaranteed flight hours. Before the Lauda lease, RNAC was reportedly profitable, but began incurring monthly losses of around NPR 20 million afterward.
*   **Ownership Discrepancy:** A PAC investigation revealed that the aircraft to be leased did not belong to Lauda Air but to a separate Hong Kong-based company not mentioned in the lease agreement.
