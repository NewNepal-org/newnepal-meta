  "title": "Narayani Hospital MRI Machine Procurement Scandal",
  "description": "<p>The case involves allegations of significant corruption and irregularities in the procurement of a 3-Tesla MRI machine for Narayani Hospital in Birgunj. The machine was purchased for approximately <strong>NPR 28-30 crore</strong> from a single bidder, <strong>Lumbini Health Care Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, despite its market value being estimated to be much lower, suggesting a fraudulent commission of over NPR 6 crore.</p><p>The procurement process, initiated in early 2022, is marred by accusations of bid-rigging or 'setting', as only one company submitted a bid. A comparison with a similar machine purchased by Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) from the same manufacturer for NPR 20 crore highlights a potential price inflation of NPR 8 to 10 crore in the Narayani Hospital deal.</p><p><strong>Conflicting Accountability:</strong></p><p>There is a significant dispute over responsibility between the hospital and the central government. The Narayani Hospital administration, including spokesperson <strong>Dr. Udayanarayan Singh</strong> and procurement chief <strong>Sushil Yadav</strong>, claim they only acted on instructions from the Ministry of Health. They allege the Ministry:</p><ul><li>Provided the estimated budget for the machine.</li><li>Formed an expert committee to set the technical specifications.</li><li>Gave final approval for the tender despite there being only a single bidder.</li></ul><p>However, officials from the Ministry of Health have denied these claims, placing full responsibility on the hospital administration.</p><p><strong>CIAA Investigation and Aftermath:</strong></p><p>Following complaints, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched an investigation. On March 1, 2023, a CIAA team <a href=\"https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2023/03/1283591\">seized procurement-related documents</a> from the hospital for review. As of mid-2024, no formal chargesheet has been filed in this specific case.</p><p>The multi-crore machine is currently <strong>non-operational</strong>. The hospital reportedly failed to pay the final 20% of the contract amount to the supplier, who in turn shut down the machine. This has forced patients to seek MRI services at private facilities for more than double the cost, defeating the purpose of the public investment.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Certain details in this case remain unconfirmed or are still under investigation:</p><ul><li>The specific names of the officials within the <strong>Ministry of Health</strong> who allegedly drafted the technical specifications and approved the single-bidder tender are not publicly known.</li><li>The exact amount of financial loss or illicit commission is yet to be formally determined by the CIAA, though initial complaints and comparisons suggest it is between <strong>NPR 6 crore and NPR 10 crore</strong>.</li><li>The precise role and actions of the then-Medical Superintendent, <strong>Dr. Birendra Bahadur Pradhan</strong>, specifically concerning the MRI procurement, are not detailed in available reports, although he was in leadership during the period. He has been implicated in a separate corruption case concerning the hospital's emergency ward construction.</li></ul>",
