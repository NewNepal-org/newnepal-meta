---

### **Structured Information**

**1. Main Allegations:**
*   **Price Inflation:** The machine was purchased for approximately NPR 30 crore (300 million), while its actual market value is alleged to be significantly lower. A complaint filed with the CIAA suggests the international price is between NPR 20 to 24 crore, indicating a potential fraudulent commission of over NPR 6 crore. Another comparison shows that Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) purchased a 3-Tesla MRI from the same Chinese manufacturer for NPR 20 crore (200 million) in April 2025, suggesting a price discrepancy of around NPR 8 to 10 crore in the Narayani Hospital deal.
*   **Procurement Irregularities:** The tender process resulted in only a single bidder, Lumbini Health Care Pvt. Ltd., whose bid was subsequently accepted. This raises suspicions of "setting" and "carteling" to exclude other competitors.
*   **Abuse of Authority:** There are conflicting claims of responsibility, with the Narayani Hospital administration accusing the Ministry of Health of managing the entire procurement process, while the Ministry denies involvement.

**2. Key Individuals and Entities:**
*   **Main Accused (as per initial brief):** Hospital Administration and Ministry of Health employees.
*   **Hospital Leadership (at time of procurement):**
    *   **Dr. Birendra Bahadur Pradhan:** Medical Superintendent (Mesu) of Narayani Hospital during the procurement period. [Referenced in previous search:] He was appointed to the position on 2078 Jestha 6 (May 20, 2021). [Referenced in previous search:]

**3. Financials:**
*   **Purchase Price:** Nearly NPR 30 crore (300 million). Another report states NPR 28 crore (280 million) excluding VAT. [Referenced in previous search:]
*   **Alleged Loss/Overpayment:** Estimated at NPR 10 to 12 crore (100 to 120 million) in the initial brief. News reports and comparable purchases suggest a discrepancy of NPR 6 to 10 crore (60 to 100 million).

### **Timeline of Events**

*   **2078 Magh (January/February 2022):** Narayani Hospital, based on specifications allegedly provided by the Ministry of Health, issued a public e-tender for the procurement of an MRI machine.
*   **2079 Mangsir (November/December 2022):** News of the controversial procurement emerged. The hospital administration publicly stated that the Ministry of Health was responsible for the technical specifications and tender approval, a claim the Ministry denied.
*   **2079 Falgun 17 (March 1, 2023):** The CIAA's central office dispatched a team of two engineers to Narayani Hospital. They inspected the MRI machine and confiscated procurement-related documents for investigation. [Referenced in previous search:]
*   **2081 Baisakh (April/May 2024):** Reports indicated that the newly installed MRI machine was non-operational. The supplier, United Imaging Healthcare, had shut down the machine because the hospital had failed to pay the remaining 20% of the total cost. [Referenced in previous search:] This forces patients to seek MRI services at private facilities for at least double the cost. [Referenced in previous search:]

### **Detailed Description & Evidence**

The core of the case is the procurement of a 3-Tesla MRI machine from a Chinese company, supplied by a Kathmandu-based firm, Lumbini Health Care Pvt. Ltd. The deal is marred by accusations of significant financial irregularities and a deliberate manipulation of the procurement process.

<p><strong>Conflicting Accounts of Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>There is a direct conflict between Narayani Hospital and the Ministry of Health regarding who is accountable for the procurement. Hospital spokesperson Dr. Udayanarayan Singh and procurement chief Sushil Yadav have publicly stated that the hospital's role was minimal. According to them, the Ministry of Health:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provided the initial estimated budget for the machine.</li>
    <li>Formed a committee of experts to create the technical specifications.</li>
    <li>Handled the final approval of the tender, even after only one company applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Singh is quoted as saying, "The hospital only called for the tender based on the technical specifications prepared and sent by the ministry... Therefore, the hospital administration had no decisive role in the MRI machine procurement process." However, officials from the Ministry of Health have refuted these claims, insisting that the hospital administration bears the full responsibility for the purchase.</p>

<p><strong>CIAA Investigation</strong></p>
<p>Following a complaint alleging corruption of more than NPR 6 crore, the CIAA initiated a formal investigation. [Referenced in previous search:] In March 2023, a technical team from the CIAA's head office visited the hospital, inspected the machine, and seized all relevant files pertaining to the purchase. [Referenced in previous search:] As of late 2025, there has been no public announcement of a formal chargesheet being filed against specific individuals in this particular MRI case.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status and Repercussions</strong></p>
<p>The expensive machine at the center of the scandal is currently non-functional. The hospital has reportedly failed to clear the final 20% of the payment owed to the supplier. [Referenced in previous search:] Consequently, the company has halted the machine's operation, and since it is still under warranty, the hospital cannot get it serviced. [Referenced in previous search:] This has had a direct impact on patients, who must now pay significantly higher fees (around NPR 16,000) at private institutions, compared to the expected rate of NPR 8,000 at the public hospital.

### **Unverified Information**

*   The exact names of the officials within the Ministry of Health who allegedly prepared the technical specifications and approved the tender are not publicly known.
*   The initial brief mentions a loss of "10 to 12 crore". While this figure is plausible given the price discrepancy with the TUTH purchase, the exact amount of illicit commission or loss is yet to be formally established by the CIAA.
*   Dr. Birendra Bahadur Pradhan has been named in a separate corruption case filed by the CIAA related to the construction of the hospital's emergency ward, but his specific role and statements regarding the MRI procurement scandal are not detailed in the available sources.
