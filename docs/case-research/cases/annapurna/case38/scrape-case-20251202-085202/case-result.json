  "title": "Rajanarayan Pathak Bribery Scandal (CIAA Commissioner)",
  "description": "<p>The case involves <strong>Rajanarayan Pathak</strong>, who, while serving as a commissioner at the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), was implicated in a major bribery scandal. He was accused of accepting a bribe of <strong>NPR 7.8 million</strong> from <strong>Lambodar Kumar Neupane</strong>, the then-chairman of Nepal Engineering College (NEC) located in Changunarayan, Bhaktapur.</p><p>The bribe was allegedly paid to influence Pathak to settle an ongoing investigation at the CIAA concerning financial irregularities and an illegal attempt by Neupane and his associates to convert the non-profit college into a for-profit private company. The scandal came to light after audio and video recordings of a sting operation were leaked to the media in early 2019. In these recordings, Pathak was seen and heard admitting to receiving the bribe money.</p><p>Following the public outcry and facing the threat of impeachment, Pathak resigned from his position on February 15, 2019. The CIAA, the very institution where he was a commissioner, launched an investigation and filed a charge sheet against both Pathak and Neupane on March 26, 2019.</p><p>On January 12, 2023, the Special Court in Kathmandu delivered its verdict. The bench, comprising judges Shrikant Paudel, Yamuna Bhattarai, and Balabhadra Bastola, found both individuals guilty. Key details of the sentence are:</p><ul><li><strong>Rajanarayan Pathak:</strong> Sentenced to 3 years and 3 months in prison and a fine of NPR 3.9 million. The additional three months were added because he committed the crime while holding a high-ranking constitutional office.</li><li><strong>Lambodar Neupane:</strong> Sentenced to 3 years in prison and a fine of NPR 3.9 million.</li></ul><p>The court convicted them for the 'attempt' to commit corruption under the Corruption Prevention Act, 2002, as the bribe money itself was not recovered. The CIAA later appealed this verdict to the Supreme Court, seeking a stricter penalty based on the argument that the act of bribery was completed, not merely attempted.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>This section contains claims made in media reports that are not fully substantiated by official court documents but provide additional context.</p><ul><li>It was reported that in his initial conversations, Pathak had demanded a total of <strong>NPR 16.5 million</strong> (1.65 crore) as a bribe.</li><li>Pathak's brother, <strong>Subha Narayan Pathak</strong>, was allegedly involved and accused of receiving a separate sum of <strong>NPR 1.5 million</strong> related to the case. The CIAA stated it would pursue a separate investigation into this claim.</li><li>During his interrogation, Pathak reportedly denied receiving the NPR 7.8 million but confessed to telling an intermediary that he would earn <strong>NPR 500 million</strong> after becoming the chief commissioner of the CIAA.</li></ul>",
