#### **II. Case Description**

<p>The case revolves around Rajanarayan Pathak, who, while serving as a commissioner for Nepal's primary anti-corruption body, the CIAA, was accused of accepting a bribe of NPR 7.8 million (78 Lakh). The bribe was allegedly paid by Lambodar Neupane, the then-chairman of Nepal Engineering College (NEC) in Bhaktapur. The payment was intended to influence Pathak to settle an ongoing investigation at the CIAA into financial irregularities and an illegal attempt by Neupane and his associates to convert the non-profit, public-trust college into a for-profit private company.</p>
<p>The scandal became public after audio and video recordings were leaked to the media in early 2019. In the recordings, Pathak is heard and seen admitting to having accepted the bribe money, which was reportedly delivered in installments. Following the leak and facing the threat of impeachment, Pathak resigned from his position as CIAA Commissioner on February 15, 2019. The CIAA, the very body where he was a commissioner, subsequently launched its own investigation into the matter.</p>

*   **Date of Verdict:** January 12, 2023
*   **Convicting Court:** Special Court, Kathmandu
*   **Presiding Judges:** Shrikant Paudel, Yamuna Bhattarai, and Balabhadra Bastola.
*   **Verdict Details:**
    <p>The court found both Pathak and Neupane guilty of corruption. However, because the bribe money itself could not be recovered from the accused, they were convicted for the "attempt" to commit corruption under the Corruption Prevention Act, 2002.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rajanarayan Pathak:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sentence:</strong> 3 years in prison.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Sentence:</strong> An additional 3 months of imprisonment as he committed the crime while holding a high-ranking constitutional office, as per Section 24 of the Corruption Prevention Act.</li>
                <li><strong>Fine:</strong> NPR 3.9 million.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Lambodar Neupane:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sentence:</strong> 3 years in prison.</li>
                <li><strong>Fine:</strong> NPR 3.9 million.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CIAA later appealed to the Supreme Court seeking a stricter penalty, arguing that the act of bribery was completed, not merely attempted.</p>
