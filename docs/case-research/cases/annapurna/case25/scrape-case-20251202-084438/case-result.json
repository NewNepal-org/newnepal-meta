  "title": "Illegal Extraction of Riverbed Materials from Ratu River by Contractors",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns allegations of large-scale illegal extraction of riverbed materials (sand, gravel, stones) from the <strong>Ratu River</strong> within Bardibas Municipality, Mahottari district. Three contractors, <strong>Panchadhuramai Suppliers</strong>, <strong>Shivam Construction Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, and <strong>Divyanshu Pvt. Ltd. Janakpur</strong>, were awarded contracts for extraction in different sections of the river during the Nepali fiscal year 2078 BS (2021/2022).</p><p>According to investigations conducted by the Bardibas Municipality, these companies are accused of collectively extracting approximately <strong>four times the legally permitted quantity</strong> of materials. The contracts reportedly limited each company to extracting 450 cubic meters per day for 270 days. The illegal activities were allegedly carried out at night during the COVID-19 lockdown period, a time when official monitoring was limited.</p><p>Mishrilal Yadav, the Head of the Municipality's Revenue Branch, stated that the contractors exploited the lockdown to engage in what he described as \"indiscriminate plunder\" of the river. The contracts stipulated that excavation should not exceed a depth of three feet, but the contractors allegedly created deep pits, violating both the contract terms and the approved Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) report.</p><p>After discovering the excessive extraction, the municipality demanded compensation for the damages and associated revenue loss. In response, the contracting companies filed a writ petition in court. As of late 2021, the case remained sub-judice.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is from initial reports but has not been fully verified by the available public sources:</p><ul><li>An initial internal case file mentioned a potential financial loss of <strong>12 Crore NPR (NPR 120,000,000)</strong>. While public sources confirm the allegation of extraction being \"four times\" the permitted limit (with original contracts valued between 1.7 to 1.82 crore NPR each), they do not explicitly state a total loss of 12 crore. This figure may be an estimation of the market value of the illegally extracted materials or the total revenue loss, but it is not confirmed in news reports.</li><li>The names of the proprietors or managing directors of Panchadhuramai Suppliers, Shivam Construction Pvt. Ltd., and Divyanshu Pvt. Ltd. Janakpur who were responsible for overseeing the contracts are not specified in the sources.</li></ul>",
