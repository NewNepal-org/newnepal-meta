### **Allegations and Modus Operandi**

The core of the case is a large-scale international fraud scheme targeting foreign citizens, primarily from the United States.

*   **The Scam:** The group contacted victims, many of whom were elderly or vulnerable, through emails and other online methods. They used pretenses such as the need to update anti-virus software or clear payments for services like Amazon, Geek Squad, and QuickBooks.
*   **Remote Access and Deception:** After establishing contact, they would gain remote access to the victims' computers and bank accounts. In a sophisticated deception, the fraudsters would show the victim a fake bank statement indicating a large, erroneous deposit had been made into their account. They would then convince the victim that this money had to be returned to avoid legal trouble under U.S. law. The victims, believing they were returning phantom money, would then authorize transfers that were actually being withdrawn from their own savings and sent to accounts in Nepal controlled by Shah's network.
*   **Money Laundering in Nepal:** The illegally obtained funds were transferred to Nepal via SWIFT code into the accounts of the numerous companies set up by Shah. To hide the illicit origin of the money, the funds were quickly invested in real estate, company shares, and gold. Investigations revealed that the group also used fake documents and thumbprints to register these companies.

*   **Total Illicit Transfers:** The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) concluded that the group funneled a total of **$4,546,639 USD**, **£22,000 GBP**, and **340,000 CAD**, amounting to a Nepali rupee equivalent of approximately **NPR 639.5 million**.
*   **Frozen Funds:** Of the total amount, **$1.5 million (approx. NPR 206.88 million)** was intercepted and held by various Nepali banks (including Kumari, NCC, and Global IME) before it could be deposited into Shah's accounts. An additional **NPR 12.89 million** already in their accounts was also frozen.
*   **Laundered and Used Funds:** Shah's group successfully accessed and used approximately **NPR 388.66 million** for investments in land, shares, and other assets.

### **Timeline of Key Events**

*   **2021-2022:** The U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) alerts Nepal Rastra Bank's Financial Information Unit (FIU) about a potential fraud scheme involving funds being transferred to accounts controlled by Prithvi Bahadur Shah.
*   **Action by NRB:** Following the U.S. alert, the FIU freezes the suspicious accounts and requests an investigation by the Department of Money Laundering Investigation (DMLI) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB).
*   **July 27, 2021:** Shah files a petition at the Supreme Court of Nepal, demanding the release of the frozen money.
*   **January 25, 2022:** The DMLI issues a letter to unfreeze Shah's accounts, stating that the evidence available at the time did not definitively establish money laundering.
*   **March 2022:** Then-Finance Minister Janardan Sharma verbally pressures NRB Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari to release the funds, framing them as legitimate foreign investment. Governor Adhikari refuses to comply.
*   **March 25, 2022:** Prithvi Shah writes a formal plea to Finance Minister Sharma requesting his help to release the funds.
*   **April 8, 2022:** On Minister Sharma's recommendation, the Cabinet forms a committee to probe Governor Adhikari, leading to his automatic suspension. The move is widely seen as retaliation for Adhikari's refusal to release Shah's money.
*   **April 19, 2022:** The Supreme Court issues an order reinstating Governor Adhikari, thwarting the government's move.
*   **January 6, 2023:** The CIB, in collaboration with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), arrests Prithvi Bahadur Shah and six of his associates.
*   **March 1, 2023:** The CIB concludes its investigation and submits the report to the District Attorney's Office, recommending prosecution on four counts: fraud, document forgery, cooperative fraud, and organized crime. The U.S. Embassy in Nepal issues a press release confirming the joint law enforcement cooperation.
*   **March 14, 2023:** The Kathmandu District Court orders Prithvi Bahadur Shah and five associates to be sent to judicial custody. Shah and his brother Vijay Bikram Shah are jailed at Dillibazar prison, while the others are sent to the Central Prison, Sundhara.

### **Unverified Information & Political Controversy**

*   <p>The core of the controversy involves the actions of then-Finance Minister <strong>Janardan Sharma</strong>. After the NRB froze the funds based on an alert from the U.S. government, Sharma actively intervened. He publicly argued that foreign investments should not be hindered and privately pressured Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari to release the money. When the Governor refused, Sharma orchestrated his suspension, a move that was later overturned by the Supreme Court.</p>
*   <p>Sharma has denied knowing Prithvi Bahadur Shah personally, claiming he only acted on an "emotional appeal" to inquire about why a foreign investment was being blocked.</p>
*   <p>Despite the DMLI's initial decision to unfreeze the accounts in January 2022, the NRB kept the funds blocked, and the investigation continued due to the gravity of the international alert.</p>
*   <p>Investigations were reportedly stalled during the tenure of the government in which Sharma was Finance Minister, and only gained momentum after a new government was formed.</p>
*   <p>The case highlights significant international cooperation between Nepal's CIB and U.S. agencies like the FBI and FinCEN, who provided crucial evidence for the prosecution.</p>
