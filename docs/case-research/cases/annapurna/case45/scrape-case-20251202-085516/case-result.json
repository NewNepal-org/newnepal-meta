  "title": "Prithvi Bahadur Shah International Fraud and Money Laundering Case",
  "description": "<p>Prithvi Bahadur Shah, a native of Achham district, is accused of leading an organized criminal group that defrauded foreign nationals, primarily from the United States, and laundered the proceeds in Nepal. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police concluded that the group illicitly funneled approximately <strong>NPR 639.5 million</strong> (equivalent to $4,546,639 USD, £22,000 GBP, and 340,000 CAD) into the country.</p><p>The group's modus operandi involved sophisticated online scams. They would contact victims, often elderly individuals, under the pretext of providing technical support for services like Amazon, Geek Squad, or anti-virus software. Gaining remote access to the victims' computers, the fraudsters would manipulate their bank interfaces to show a fake, large deposit. They would then convince the victims to 'return' this non-existent money, tricking them into transferring their own savings to bank accounts in Nepal controlled by Shah's network.</p><p>To launder the money, Shah and his associates established over 24 companies in Nepal, including <strong>World Export and Import Private Limited</strong> and <strong>'Hunting Reserve of Nepal Pvt Ltd'</strong>. The illicit funds were quickly invested in real estate, company shares, and gold to obscure their criminal origin. Investigations revealed the use of forged documents and thumbprints for company registrations.</p><p>The case gained prominence after the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) alerted Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), leading to the freezing of Shah's accounts. The case also sparked a major political controversy involving then-Finance Minister Janardan Sharma, who allegedly pressured the NRB to release the frozen funds.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The case is marked by significant political controversy surrounding the alleged actions of then-Finance Minister <strong>Janardan Sharma</strong>. After Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) froze the suspicious funds based on an alert from the U.S. government, Minister Sharma reportedly intervened.</p><ul><li>He is accused of privately pressuring NRB Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari to release the money, arguing it was legitimate foreign investment that should not be blocked.</li><li>When Governor Adhikari refused to comply, Sharma allegedly orchestrated his suspension by the cabinet, a move that was later overturned by the Supreme Court.</li><li>Sharma has publicly denied knowing Prithvi Bahadur Shah personally, stating he only acted on an 'emotional appeal' to inquire why a foreign investment was being held up.</li></ul><p>It was also reported that the investigation into Shah's activities stalled during the tenure of the government in which Sharma served as Finance Minister, only gaining significant momentum after a change in government.</p>",
