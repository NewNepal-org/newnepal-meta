### **Case Details**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Case Name** | The Rawal Commission Report on Public Land Encroachment |
| **Date of Initiation** | 1992-12-31 |
| **Status** | Report submitted but largely unimplemented for over two decades; recent municipal efforts to enforce findings. |
| **Type of Corruption** | Land Grabbing / Encroachment of Public and Government Land |
| **Location** | Kathmandu District, Nepal |

### **Summary**
The case revolves around the findings of the "High Level Commission on Government and Public Land Inquiry and Conservation," popularly known as the Rawal Commission. Formed in late 1992 (2049 BS) by the government of then-Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, the commission was chaired by former secretary Ram Bahadur Rawal. After two years of investigation, the commission submitted a comprehensive report identifying that **1,859 ropani and 14 anna** of public and government land had been illegally encroached upon by approximately 5,000 individuals and organizations within Kathmandu.

Despite its detailed findings, the report was effectively shelved by successive governments for nearly 25 years and was not made public. Officials suggested this was due to the involvement of influential people. In 2010, the Supreme Court ordered the government to implement the report's recommendations, but action remained stalled. The full 1,350+ page report only became public after the Centre for Investigative Journalism-Nepal (CIJ-Nepal) obtained it through a Right to Information request in 2019 and published an exposé. More recently, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, under Mayor Balendra Shah, has initiated a campaign to reclaim the land identified in the Rawal Report.

### **Description**
<p>On December 31, 1992, the Nepali government, led by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, established the 'High Level Commission on Government and Public Land Inquiry and Conservation' in response to growing complaints about the illegal occupation of public lands. The commission was headed by former secretary Ram Bahadur Rawal.</p>
<p>After a two-year investigation, the commission submitted its report around 1994. The investigation revealed that a total of <strong>1,859 ropani, 14 anna of public and government-owned land</strong> had been illegally encroached upon within the Kathmandu district. The report identified around 5,000 individuals and organizations as being involved in the encroachments. Key areas affected included valuable urban locations like Chabahil, Bouddha, Battisputali, Thapathali, Baneshwor, Koteshwor, Handigaun, and Budhanilkantha. The types of land encroached upon were diverse, including ponds, temples, streams, wells, public paths, and guthi (trust) land.</p>
<p>Despite the detailed nature of the report, it was not acted upon by government authorities for nearly 25 years. An official at the Ministry of Land Management suggested the inaction was deliberate because many powerful and high-ranking individuals were implicated in the report. The report's details remained secret until the Centre for Investigative Journalism-Nepal (CIJ-Nepal) used the Right to Information Act to obtain the full 1,350-page document, publishing its findings on May 2, 2019.</p>
<p>In a significant legal development on May 26, 2010, the Supreme Court of Nepal, responding to a writ filed by advocate Prakash Mani Sharma, issued a directive ordering the government to implement the Rawal Commission's report with high priority. However, this order also saw limited enforcement. In recent years, the issue has been revived by the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). Mayor Balendra Shah has announced a major campaign to reclaim the encroached public properties, citing the Rawal Commission's report as the basis for action and forming a new committee to oversee its implementation. The estimated value of the encroached land is approximately Rs 200 billion.</p>
