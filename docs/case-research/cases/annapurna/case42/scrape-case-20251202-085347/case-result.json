  "title": "Rawal Commission Report on Public Land Encroachment in Kathmandu",
  "description": "<p>The case revolves around the findings of the 'High Level Commission on Government and Public Land Inquiry and Conservation', popularly known as the Rawal Commission. Formed on <strong>December 31, 1992</strong>, by the government of then-Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and chaired by former secretary Ram Bahadur Rawal, the commission was tasked with investigating the illegal occupation of public and government land in Kathmandu.</p><p>After a two-year investigation, the commission submitted its report around 1994. It revealed that a total of <strong>1,859 ropani and 14 anna</strong> of public and government-owned land had been illegally encroached upon by approximately 5,000 individuals and organizations. The report identified encroachments in valuable urban areas such as Chabahil, Bouddha, Thapathali, and Baneshwor, affecting public paths, ponds, streams, and temple lands.</p><p>Despite its comprehensive findings, the report was effectively shelved by successive governments for nearly 25 years. Officials have suggested this inaction was due to the involvement of influential and high-ranking individuals. On <strong>May 26, 2010</strong>, the Supreme Court of Nepal, responding to a writ petition by advocate Prakash Mani Sharma, issued a directive ordering the government to implement the report's recommendations with high priority, but significant action was not taken.</p><p>The full 1,350-page report remained confidential until the Centre for Investigative Journalism-Nepal (CIJ-Nepal) obtained it through a Right to Information (RTI) request and published a detailed exposé on <strong>May 2, 2019</strong>. This publication brought the issue back into the public discourse.</p><p>More recently, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), under Mayor Balendra Shah, has launched a campaign to reclaim the encroached lands, citing the Rawal Commission's report as a primary basis for its actions. The estimated market value of the encroached land is approximately <strong>NPR 200 billion</strong>.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While the Rawal Commission report is extensive, a complete and consolidated public list of all ~5,000 implicated individuals and organizations is not readily available in a single document. The Centre for Investigative Journalism-Nepal has published a searchable database with names from the report, but not the complete list in one place.</p><p>The specific identities of the 'powerful and high-ranking individuals' who allegedly obstructed the implementation of the report for over two decades have not been officially disclosed or investigated.</p><p>The exact date in 1994 when the commission submitted its final report is not specified in the source materials, though it is consistently cited as being after a two-year investigation.</p>",
