  "description": "<p>The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has filed at least five separate corruption cases against former Chief Administrative Officers, engineers, technicians, and contractors of Godawari Municipality in Kailali District. The charges primarily revolve around the construction of 13 municipal roads where payments were allegedly made for substandard and incomplete work, causing significant financial loss to the state. [2, 6, 7, 8]</p><p>The investigation revealed that officials, including then-Chief Administrative Officers <strong>Khemraj Bista</strong> and <strong>Devraj Joshi</strong>, knowingly approved payments based on incorrect and faulty measurement books for poor-quality road construction. [8, 9] They are accused of overstepping their jurisdiction by interfering in the technical evaluation process and colluding with contractors to embezzle government funds. [2, 8, 9] The CIAA has filed chargesheets at the Special Court in Kathmandu, seeking to recover millions of rupees in damages from the accused. [6]</p>",

However, all subsequent media and official reports consistently name the second accused Chief Administrative Officer as '<strong>Devraj Joshi</strong>'.

While specific amounts claimed from contractors are in this range (e.g., 2.9 million from one [6]), the total alleged corruption across all related cases is significantly higher. [6, 7]</p>"
