  "title": "Godawari Municipality Road Construction Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed five separate corruption cases against officials and contractors of Godawari Municipality, Kailali, over irregularities in the construction of 13 municipal roads. The accused allegedly caused significant financial loss to the state by making and approving payments for substandard and incomplete work.</p><p>The investigation revealed that former Chief Administrative Officers <strong>Khemraj Bista</strong> and <strong>Devraj Joshi</strong> colluded with engineers, sub-engineers, and contractors. They are accused of knowingly approving payments based on fraudulent measurement books and technical reports that misrepresented the quality and progress of the road construction projects.</p><p>The CIAA filed chargesheets at the Special Court in Kathmandu, implicating a total of 14 individuals. The key individuals and the total claimed damages (bigo) sought by the CIAA are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Khemraj Bista</strong> (Former Chief Administrative Officer): NPR 64,806,216</li><li><strong>Devraj Joshi</strong> (Former Chief Administrative Officer): NPR 3,129,746</li><li><strong>Purna Kunwar</strong> (Former Engineer): NPR 9,615,962</li><li><strong>Gyanendra Budha</strong> (Former Sub-Engineer): NPR 3,219,514</li><li><strong>Narendra Shahi</strong> (Former Sub-Engineer): NPR 3,677,000</li><li><strong>Bhaktaraj Joshi</strong> (Former Sub-Engineer): NPR 2,758,432</li><li><strong>Dhan Bahadur Bista</strong> (Lab Technician): NPR 8,441,923</li><li><strong>Dambar Chand</strong> (Contractor): NPR 8,200,000</li><li><strong>Santosh Joshi</strong> (Contractor): NPR 3,798,000</li><li><strong>Kami Sherpa</strong> (Contractor): NPR 2,928,000</li><li><strong>Harisingh Bista</strong> (Contractor): NPR 1,517,000</li></ul><p>The charges include corruption, abuse of authority, and collusion to embezzle government funds. The case highlights a systemic issue of officials overstepping their jurisdiction to interfere in technical evaluations for personal gain.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>An initial document reviewed for this case listed one of the accused as 'Khemraj Joshi'. However, all subsequent official press releases from the CIAA and reputable media reports consistently name the second accused Chief Administrative Officer as <strong>Devraj Joshi</strong>. It is highly probable that 'Khemraj Joshi' was a typographical error in the initial source.</p>",
