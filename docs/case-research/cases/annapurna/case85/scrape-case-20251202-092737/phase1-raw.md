### **Case Summary: Solu Corridor Transmission Line Tender Controversy**

**Case ID:** 85 (Internal Database)
**Subject:** Alleged irregularity in the tendering process for the Solu Corridor 132 kV Transmission Line Project.
**Year of Key Events:** 2015-2016 (2071-2072 BS)

---

### **1. Description**
<p>The case involves allegations of corruption and irregularity against then-incumbent CPN-UML Energy Minister, Radha Kumari Gyawali, and several officials of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). The accusations were made by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) in 2015. The core of the controversy was the decision by the NEA board, chaired by Minister Gyawali, to award the construction contract for the 90-kilometer Solu Corridor 132 kV Transmission Line to the second-lowest bidder.</p>
<p>The CIAA alleged that this decision demonstrated 'mala fide intentions' and would cause a significant financial loss to the state. The lowest bidder, a joint venture of Jaguar Overseas Ltd and BS Ltd, was disqualified based on what the CIAA considered minor technical issues that should have been clarified rather than used for outright disqualification. This led to the CIAA recommending action against the minister and other officials involved.</p>
<p>Following the CIAA's recommendation, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala dismissed Minister Gyawali from her post on October 1, 2015. However, Gyawali and the other accused officials challenged the CIAA's directive in the Supreme Court. On March 16, 2016, a joint bench of Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha and Justice Jagadish Sharma Paudel ruled in favor of Gyawali, annulling the CIAA's directives. The court's decision effectively cleared her and the other officials of the charges leveled by the anti-graft body. The case also drew scrutiny from the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC).</p>

### **5. Allegations vs. Defense**

<ul>
    <li><strong>Allegation (CIAA):</strong> The NEA Board and Minister Gyawali deliberately and with ill intent bypassed the lowest bidder to award the contract to a preferred party, causing a loss of NPR 270 million to the state. The reasons for disqualifying the lowest bidder (e.g., bid guarantee in Indian currency, experience) were minor and the bidder should have been asked for clarification.</li>
    <li><strong>Defense (NEA Board/Gyawali):</strong> The bid evaluation committee acted on the report of the project consultant, Lahmeyer International, which had recommended disqualifying the Jaguar/BS joint venture on multiple technical grounds, including insufficient experience and improper submission of the bid guarantee. This position was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.</li>

### **7. Unverified Information**
<p>The initial information provided to the research assistant contained a case name "Chleliya" and a loss amount of "55 Crore". Extensive research has found no credible sources corroborating either of these details. All evidence points to the case being the <strong>Solu Corridor Transmission Line</strong> controversy and the verifiable financial discrepancy being approximately <strong>NPR 27 Crore</strong> ($2.62 million). The "55 Crore" figure is considered erroneous unless a primary document surfaces that explains it.</p>
