  "title": "Solu Corridor Transmission Line Tender Controversy",
  "description": "<p>The case involves allegations of corruption and procedural irregularity against then-Energy Minister Radha Kumari Gyawali and several officials of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) concerning the tender for the <strong>Solu Corridor 132 kV Transmission Line Project</strong>. In 2015, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) accused the NEA board, chaired by Minister Gyawali, of acting with 'mala fide intentions' by disqualifying the lowest bidder and awarding the contract to the second-lowest bidder.</p><p>The lowest bid, from a joint venture of Jaguar Overseas Ltd and BS Ltd, was for <strong>$20.35 million</strong>. The contract was awarded to Mohan Energy Corporation for <strong>$22.97 million</strong>, creating a potential loss of <strong>$2.62 million (approximately NPR 270 million)</strong> to the state. The CIAA argued that the disqualification was based on minor technicalities that should have been clarified.</p><p>Key events included:</p><ul><li>The CIAA recommending that Prime Minister Sushil Koirala take action against Minister Gyawali.</li><li>Prime Minister Koirala dismissing Gyawali from her post on October 1, 2015.</li><li>Gyawali and other accused officials challenging the CIAA's decision in the Supreme Court.</li></ul><p>On <strong>March 16, 2016</strong>, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha annulled the CIAA's directives. The court's verdict effectively exonerated Gyawali and the other NEA officials, finding that the decision to disqualify the lowest bidder was based on the consultant's report and did not constitute corruption. The Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also investigated the matter separately.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Initial research notes contained mentions of a case named <strong>\"Chleliya\"</strong> and an alleged loss amount of <strong>\"55 Crore\" (NPR 550 million)</strong>. However, comprehensive verification against credible sources has found no evidence to support either of these details in connection with this case. All verifiable reports identify the project as the Solu Corridor Transmission Line and the potential loss as approximately <strong>NPR 27 Crore</strong>. The \"55 Crore\" figure is therefore considered erroneous unless primary documentation proves otherwise.</p>",
