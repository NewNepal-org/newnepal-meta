  "title": "Mahendranagar Development Committee Public Land Sale Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>This case involves the alleged illegal sale and leasing of a significant portion of public land belonging to the former <strong>Mahendranagar Development Committee</strong> in Kanchanpur district. The committee, which originally held 638 bighas of land, was left with only 66 bighas, with an estimated <strong>572 bighas</strong> misappropriated, valued at over <strong>NPR 2.5 billion</strong>.</p><p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) initiated an investigation following complaints of widespread corruption. The probe revealed that former committee chairpersons allegedly made unilateral decisions to sell and lease land, bypassing mandatory board approvals. These actions violated the <strong>Town Development Act, 2045</strong>, and the <strong>Town Development Directive, 2061</strong>.</p><p>The CIAA alleged collusion between the committee's leadership, staff, and officials at the Land Revenue and Survey offices in Kanchanpur who facilitated the registration and demarcation of the illegally transferred land.</p><p>On April 24, 2022, the CIAA filed charges at the Special Court against dozens of individuals, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Former Committee Chairpersons:</strong> Paltu Rana, Gopal Rasaili, Pushkal Chaudhary, and Kanturam Paneru.</li><li><strong>Committee Staff:</strong> Member Secretary Chandra Prasad Chaudhary, Nayab Subba Pushparaj Bhatt, and Amin Tuladatt Joshi.</li><li><strong>Government Officials:</strong> Employees from the Land Revenue Office and Survey Office of Kanchanpur.</li><li><strong>Land Purchasers and Intermediaries.</strong></li></ul><p>On May 6, 2024, the <a href=\"https://lekhajokhanews.com/news/12242\">Special Court delivered a verdict</a>, convicting former chairpersons Rasaili, Rana, and Chaudhary, along with three committee staff members. They were sentenced to prison, and the court ordered the confiscation of the illegally distributed land. However, the court acquitted 14 officials from the Land Revenue and Survey offices, reasoning they were acting procedurally based on the committee's directives. The CIAA disagreed with the acquittals and has since appealed the decision to the <strong>Supreme Court</strong>, where the case is currently pending.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are several inconsistencies and unverified details across different reports, requiring further investigation:</p><ul><li><strong>Number of Accused:</strong> The exact number of individuals charged by the CIAA is unclear. Reports variously mention <a href=\"https://dhangadhipost.com/2022/10/19/84045/\">37 individuals</a>, <a href=\"https://thahakhabar.com/news/149887/\">64 individuals</a>, or a first phase involving 111 people. This discrepancy may be due to multiple charge sheets being filed at different times for different aspects of the case.</li><li><strong>Conflicting Financial Claims:</strong> The specific amounts of corruption claimed from the accused chairpersons vary significantly between sources. For instance:<ul><li>One report claims damages of NPR 850,000 from Gopal Rasaili, NPR 3,792,000 from Paltu Rana, and NPR 374,880 from Pushkal Chaudhary.</li><li>Another report, cited by <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/ciaa-probing-land-fraud-case-worth-billions-of-rupees-in-mahendranagar/\">myRepublica</a>, mentions much higher claims, including NPR 29,400,000 from Gopal Rasaili, NPR 7,310,000 from Paltu Rana, and NPR 2,970,000 from Kanturam Paneru.</li><li>Claims against other officials also include NPR 30 million from Nayab Subba Pushparaj Bhatt and NPR 38 million from surveyor Tuladatta Joshi. These variations could reflect different charges across separate cases or different methods of calculating losses.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Total Involvement:</strong> An early CIAA statement suggested that over 400 people could be involved in the land grab, but formal charges have been filed against a smaller number so far.</li></ul>",
