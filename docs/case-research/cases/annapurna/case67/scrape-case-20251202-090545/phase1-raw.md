Below are the comprehensive raw findings on the Mahendranagar Development Committee land sale corruption case.

***

### **Case Summary**

The case involves the illegal sale and leasing of a vast area of public land belonging to the former Mahendranagar Town Development Committee in Kanchanpur district. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) initiated a probe following complaints of massive corruption, leading to charges against former committee chairpersons, government employees from the Land Revenue and Survey offices, and land purchasers. The scheme allegedly involved violating the Town Development Act by selling and leasing land without proper board decisions and at the unilateral direction of the chairpersons. The case has gone through the Special Court, which convicted some of the primary accused but acquitted many government officials, a decision the CIAA has since appealed to the Supreme Court.

### **Timeline of Events**

| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Event |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unknown** | The Mahendranagar Development Committee allegedly began illegally selling and leasing public land under the direction of its chairpersons. The actions were reportedly done without board approval and in violation of the Town Development Act, 2045, and Town Development Directive, 2061. |
| **2022-04-24** | The CIAA filed a charge sheet at the Special Court in Kathmandu against 64 individuals, including former chairpersons, committee staff, and government officials from the Land Revenue and Survey offices.

| **2024-05-06** | The Special Court delivered its verdict.

### **Allegations & Unverified Information**

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;">
    <p>The core allegation is that the <strong>Mahendranagar Development Committee systematically and illegally transferred public land to private individuals</strong> through illicit sales and leases. The investigation by the CIAA uncovered a process that allegedly bypassed legal requirements and official procedures.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Allegations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unilateral Decisions:</strong> The former chairpersons of the committee are accused of making unilateral decisions ('एकल तोक आदेश') to distribute land without the necessary approval from the committee's board.</li>
        <li><strong>Violation of Law:</strong> The land transfers violated the <strong>Town Development Act, 2045</strong>, and the <strong>Town Development Directive, 2061</strong>, which outline the specific procedures for managing and distributing such land.</li>
        <li><strong>Collusion:</strong> The charge sheet alleges collusion between the committee officials, employees at the Land Revenue (Malpot) office who processed the transfers, and employees at the Survey (Napi) office who were involved in demarcating the plots (कित्ताकाट).</li>
        <li><strong>Scale of Involvement:</strong> An initial investigation by the CIAA suggested that more than 400 people could be involved in the land grab case, indicating a widespread and organized scheme. The CIAA's Mahendranagar chief, Ram Bahadur Kurungwang, stated that in the first phase, cases were filed against 111 people, with more to follow as evidence is collected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Unverified and Inconsistent Information:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The exact number of accused individuals is inconsistent across reports. Some sources mention 37, others 64, while the CIAA itself stated 111 people were charged in the first phase. This likely reflects that multiple, separate charge sheets were filed over time.</li>
        <li>There is a significant discrepancy in the corruption amounts claimed from the chairpersons. One set of figures is relatively low (under NPR 4 million each), while another set is much higher (ranging from NPR 2.9 million to NPR 29.4 million). This could be due to different cases focusing on different land parcels or different types of charges (e.g., unjust enrichment vs. causing loss to the state).</li>
    </ul>
