  "title": "Encroachment of Baidyanath Dham Guthi Land in Achham",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the alleged encroachment of a large tract of land belonging to the <strong>Baidyanath Dham Guthi</strong>, a historically significant religious trust in Achham District, Nepal. A government-appointed commission and the Guthi Sansthan (Guthi Corporation) have concluded that <strong>862 Ropani and 3 Paisa</strong> (approximately 106.5 acres) of land have been illegally occupied by 171 families.</p><p>The Guthi's claim dates back to a royal decree (Lalmohar) issued by King Rana Bahadur Shah in approximately 1795 AD (1852 BS), which granted it around one thousand ropani of land. A subsequent survey in 1929 AD (1986 BS) also recorded this ownership. However, currently, only 137 ropani are officially registered in the Guthi's name.</p><p>The conflict escalated when the Guthi Sansthan decided to reclaim the land. The 171 families residing on the disputed plots, organized under the <strong>'Baidyanath Guthi Land Victims Struggle Committee'</strong>, launched protests, including padlocking the temple. These residents possess land ownership certificates (Lalpurja) and claim they are the rightful owners, having inherited the land from their ancestors. They allege a conspiracy to make them landless, arguing that the note 'Baidyanath Dham Guthi' on their pre-2002 certificates is being used to unjustly usurp their private property.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information requires further investigation:</p><ul><li><strong>Government Commission Report:</strong> A report from the 'Commission to Investigate Government, Public, and Guthi Land' confirming the encroachment was submitted to then-Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli around 2020. However, <strong>this report has not been made public</strong>, so its full findings, evidence, and recommendations are unknown.</li><li><strong>Involvement of CIAA:</strong> There is no specific public record of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launching a formal investigation into this particular case of land encroachment at Baidyanath Dham.</li></ul>",
