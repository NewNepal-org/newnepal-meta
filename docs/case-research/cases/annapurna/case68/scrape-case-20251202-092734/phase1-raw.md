### **4. Timeline of Events**

*   **1795 AD (1852 BS):** King Rana Bahadur Shah issues a royal decree (Lalmohar) allocating approximately 1,000 ropani of land and three villages to the Baidyanath Dham Guthi.
*   **1929 AD (1986 BS):** A land survey confirms the temple's ownership of 1,000 ropani of land.
*   **Before 2002 AD (2058 BS):** Land ownership certificates (Lalpurja) are issued to local individuals for plots of this land. Crucially, these certificates bear the name of the individual owner but have "Baidyanath Dham Guthi" written on the top.
*   **c. 2020 AD (2077 BS):** The "Commission to Investigate Government, Public, and Guthi Land" conducts an investigation and submits a report to the Prime Minister confirming that 862 ropani of the Guthi's land has been encroached upon. The report is not officially released to the public.
*   **c. 2022 AD:** The Guthi Sansthan's central office in Kathmandu formally decides that the disputed land belongs to the Guthi, not the individuals occupying it.
*   **September 2, 2023 (and surrounding period):** In response to the Guthi Sansthan's decision and its preparations to reclaim the land, local residents, organized under the "Baidyanath Guthi Land Victims Struggle Committee" (वैद्यनाथ गुठी जग्गा पीडित सरोकार समिति), launch protests. They claim the government is trying to render them landless (sukumbasi) and have resorted to measures such as padlocking the temple.

### **5. Allegations, Claims, and Quotes**

*   **Claim by Guthi Sansthan and Government:** The land historically belongs to the Baidyanath Dham Guthi, and the 171 families are illegal encroachers. The presence of "Baidyanath Dham Guthi" on the ownership certificates is cited as evidence of the Guthi's underlying ownership.
*   **Claim by Local Residents:**
    *   The residents claim they are the rightful owners, having inherited the land from their ancestors who had been living on and cultivating it.
    *   They allege that their private property is being unjustly taken from them through "forged documents" and manipulation.
    *   Lob Bahadur Bohara stated, "They are trying to grab our land by writing 'Baidyanath Dham Guthi' at the top of the land ownership certificates made before 2058 BS." He added, "We are the protectors of Baidyanath Dham. But the government is forcibly making us squatters."
    *   The "Baidyanath Guthi Land Victims Struggle Committee" has accused the authorities of a "conspiracy to forcibly make them landless."

### **6. Unverified Information / Leads**

*   There is no specific mention of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launching a formal investigation into this specific case, although the CIAA has been involved in other Guthi land corruption cases and has directed the government to better protect Guthi lands.
*   The full, detailed report submitted by the government investigation commission to the Prime Minister's office has not been made public, so its complete findings and recommendations are unknown.
