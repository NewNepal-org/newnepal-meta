  "title": "2022 Budget Formulation Scandal: Allegations of Unauthorized Tax Rate Manipulation by Finance Minister Janardan Sharma",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns allegations that then-Finance Minister Janardan Sharma permitted unauthorized individuals to enter the Ministry of Finance on the night of <strong>May 28, 2022</strong>, to manipulate tax rates in the national budget for the fiscal year 2079/80 (2022/23). The changes were allegedly made to favor specific business interests.</p><p>The controversy erupted after the <em>Annapurna Post</em> published an exposé on June 20, 2022. The primary allegation centered on two individuals, one of whom was later widely identified in media reports as Raghunath Ghimire, a former non-gazetted government officer. In response to mounting public pressure and protests from the main opposition party, CPN-UML, the House of Representatives formed an <strong>11-member Parliamentary Probe Special Committee</strong> on July 6, 2022. On the same day, Minister Sharma resigned to facilitate the investigation, while denying any wrongdoing.</p><p>A key piece of evidence, the CCTV footage from the night of the incident, became a point of contention. The Ministry of Finance initially claimed the footage had been automatically deleted due to a 13-day storage limit, a practice contrary to government guidelines. However, the probe committee later had the hard drive analyzed by the Nepal Police's forensic lab, which successfully recovered the footage. Despite the recovery, the committee's final report stated the footage was not clear enough to identify individuals.</p><p>On <strong>July 29, 2022</strong>, the probe committee submitted its report to the Speaker of the House. The majority report, supported by members of the ruling coalition, concluded there was <strong>no evidence to substantiate the allegations</strong> and exonerated Sharma. Members of the CPN-UML on the committee registered a note of dissent, arguing that the investigation was deliberately incomplete and that their requests for crucial evidence, such as call detail records of Sharma and Ghimire, were rejected by the majority. They accused the ruling coalition of a cover-up.</p><p>Following his exoneration, Janardan Sharma was reappointed as Finance Minister on <strong>July 31, 2022</strong>. Key officials who had expressed reservations, such as Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini, were subsequently transferred from the ministry.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While the investigation and media reports focused on the allegations, several key details remain unconfirmed or were not conclusively proven by the parliamentary probe.</p><ul><li><strong>Identity of the Second Individual:</strong> Reports consistently mentioned at least two unauthorized individuals entered the ministry, but only Raghunath Ghimire was publicly named. The identity of the second person has never been verified.</li><li><strong>Specific Tax Changes:</strong> The core allegation was that tax rates were altered to benefit certain business groups. However, the specific articles, schedules, or tax codes that were allegedly manipulated, and the identities of the beneficiary businesses, were never publicly substantiated or detailed in the probe committee's report.</li><li><strong>Content of CCTV Footage:</strong> Although the Nepal Police forensic lab recovered the deleted CCTV footage, the full, unedited content was not made public. The committee's summary conclusion that it was 'unclear' has been met with skepticism, and the specific details of what the footage showed remain unverified.</li></ul>",
