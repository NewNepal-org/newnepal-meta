### **2. Core Allegations**

*   On the night of **May 28, 2022**, a day before presenting the national budget, then-Finance Minister Janardan Sharma allegedly allowed at least two unauthorized individuals to enter the Ministry of Finance.
*   These individuals, one of whom was later identified in media reports as former *nayab subba* (non-gazetted first-class officer) Raghunath Ghimire, are accused of tweaking and manipulating tax rates in the budget.
*   The changes were allegedly made to benefit specific business groups and industrialists.
*   The initial report exposing the incident was published by the *Annapurna Post*, a Nepali daily, on **June 20, 2022**, citing unnamed sources.

### **3. Timeline of Key Events**

*   **2022-05-28:** The alleged incident occurs. Unauthorized individuals are said to have entered the Ministry of Finance at night to alter tax rates in the final hours of budget preparation.
*   **2022-05-29:** Finance Minister Janardan Sharma presents the budget for the fiscal year 2079/80 (2022-23) in Parliament.
*   **2022-06-20:** *Annapurna Post* breaks the story, sparking public and political outcry.
*   **2022-07-03:** In response to a Right to Information (RTI) request for CCTV footage from May 28, the Ministry of Finance states that the footage was automatically deleted as its system could only store recordings for 13 days. This was noted to be contrary to government guidelines requiring footage to be kept for at least three months.
*   **2022-07-06:**
    *   Following sustained pressure from the main opposition party (CPN-UML) and the public, the House of Representatives forms an 11-member Parliamentary Probe Special Committee to investigate the allegations.
    *   Finance Minister Janardan Sharma announces his resignation in Parliament, stating he is stepping down to facilitate the investigation, while denying any wrongdoing.
    *   Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini goes on indefinite leave, in a move widely seen as a protest against Sharma's handling of the controversy.
*   **2022-07-12:** The parliamentary committee officially begins its investigation.
*   **2022-07-21:**
    *   The committee questions Janardan Sharma for three hours. He denies all allegations, calling them "fabricated" and stating that only authorized officials were involved in the budget process.
    *   The committee's initial 10-day mandate is extended by seven days.
*   **2022-07-26:** The Nepal Police's forensic lab successfully recovers the "deleted" CCTV footage from the Ministry's hard drive and submits it to the probe committee. However, reports indicated the recovered footage was not clear enough to recognize the individuals.
*   **2022-07-29:** The probe committee submits its final report to the Speaker of the House. The majority report concludes that it found no evidence to prove the allegations of unauthorized entry and exonerates Sharma. CPN-UML members on the committee express their dissent, stating the investigation was not thorough enough and that the ruling coalition members acted to give Sharma a clean chit.
*   **2022-07-31:** Following his exoneration by the committee, Janardan Sharma is reappointed as Finance Minister.
*   **2022-08-04:** Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini, who had refused to work under the reappointed Sharma, is transferred to the Prime Minister's Office.
*   **2022-08-11:** Revenue Secretary Krishna Hari Pushkar, who was also present in the ministry on the night of the alleged incident, is proposed as the new Finance Secretary.
*   **2023-04-02:** The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) files a separate corruption case against Raghunath Ghimire, accusing him of illegally amassing wealth worth over Rs 21.4 million during his tenure as a public official (from 1995 to 2019). This case is for illicit enrichment and is distinct from the budget manipulation probe, but media reports highlighted his connection to the Sharma scandal.

### **4. Key Individuals and Their Roles**

*   **Janardan Sharma (Main Accused):** As Finance Minister, he was accused of orchestrating the entry of unauthorized people to alter tax rates. He consistently denied the allegations, resigned to facilitate a probe, and was reinstated after the probe committee found no evidence against him. In his defense, he claimed to have followed all established procedures.
*   **Raghunath Ghimire (Alleged Unauthorized Person):** A former non-gazetted government officer (*nayab subba*) and chartered accountant. He was named in media reports and by opposition lawmakers as the individual who entered the ministry. UML lawmakers demanded his call details be investigated. A year later, he was charged in a separate and unrelated corruption case for amassing illegal wealth while in public service.
*   **Madhu Kumar Marasini (then-Finance Secretary):** He was reportedly present in the ministry on the night of May 28. He went on leave when the controversy peaked and Sharma did not resign, and later informed the Prime Minister he would not return to work under Sharma. After Sharma's reappointment, Marasini was transferred.
*   **Krishna Hari Pushkar (then-Revenue Secretary):** Also present during the final budget preparations. He, along with other ministry officials, dismissed the allegations of outsider involvement during questioning by the probe committee. He was later appointed Finance Secretary after Marasini's transfer.

### **5. Evidence and Investigation**

*   **CCTV Footage:** This was the central piece of potential evidence.
    *   The Finance Ministry initially claimed footage of the specific date had been deleted due to a 13-day storage limit.
    *   The parliamentary probe committee sent the hard drive to a Nepal Police forensic lab for analysis.
    *   The lab recovered 51 video clips from May 28 but reported that they were not clear enough for identification.
*   **Parliamentary Probe Committee:**
    *   The 11-member committee included four members from the opposition CPN-UML and seven from the ruling coalition parties.
    *   It questioned Minister Sharma, senior Finance Ministry officials (including Marasini and Pushkar), and the *Annapurna Post* journalists who broke the story.
    *   The ministry officials denied any outsider was present. The journalists stood by their story but did not reveal their sources.
    *   The committee's final report stated there was no evidence to prove the allegations.
    *   **Dissenting Opinion:** CPN-UML members on the panel registered their disagreement, arguing that key investigative steps, such as obtaining call detail records of Sharma and Ghimire and conducting a lie detector test, were rejected by the committee's majority. They accused the ruling parties of a cover-up.

### **6. Unverified Information & Open Questions**

*   **Identity of the Second "Unauthorized" Person:** While Raghunath Ghimire was repeatedly named, reports often mentioned *two* outsiders. The identity of the second person was not publicly confirmed.
*   **Specific Tax Rates Altered:** It was widely alleged that tax rates were changed, but the specific articles, schedules, or tax codes that were manipulated and the business houses that benefited were not conclusively proven or detailed in the available reports.
*   **Contents of the Unclear CCTV Footage:** While the police report stated the footage was recovered, the detailed contents and reasons for it being "unclear" were not made public beyond the committee's summary.
