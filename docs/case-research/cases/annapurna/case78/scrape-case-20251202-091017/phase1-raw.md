### **Description of Case**

<p>The case revolves around the upgradation of a 6-kilometer section of the historic Thankot-Chandragiri-Chitlang road. The contract for widening the road to 9 meters was awarded to <strong>Kirateshwar Construction Drilling Company Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, which appears to be part of the P.S./Kirateshwar Joint Venture mentioned in the initial case file. The project had a stated budget of 5 crore NPR and began around the year 2074 BS.</p>

<p>Allegations surfaced that the contractor was engaged in illegally selling excavated materials for profit. Instead of using the stones and rocks extracted during road widening for building necessary retaining walls and filling gabion boxes on-site, the company was accused of collecting the stones in large piles and transporting them elsewhere for sale. This practice was described by some as the contractor securing a "double profit"—once from the government contract and again from the illicit sale of state resources.</p>

<p>The issue was publicly raised by local residents and acknowledged by <strong>Rama Ale Magar</strong>, a member of the provincial assembly. She confirmed that despite locals demanding the excavated stones be used for the project's own structural needs, this was not happening, and there were widespread complaints that the stones were being sold off. The excessive and improper excavation also led to significant environmental concerns, including deforestation and an increased risk of landslides in the steep terrain, threatening lower-lying areas.</p>

<p>In his defense, <strong>Sanat Singh Rai</strong>, the operator of the construction company, denied the allegations. He claimed that the large quantity of excavated rock was an unavoidable result of using heavy machinery on the steep terrain and that the collected stones were intended for use within the project itself, not for sale. The project also faced delays due to a jurisdictional dispute over whether the road fell under local, provincial, or central government authority. News reports also confirmed that a "stone trade" was happening on the road, prompting promises from officials to stop it and expedite the construction.</p>
