The case involves corruption in the procurement of bicycles under the ‘Beti Padhau, Beti Bachao’ (Educate a Daughter, Save a Daughter) program initiated by the Madhesh Province government (formerly Province 2). The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) investigated irregularities in the fiscal year 2077 (2020/2021), alleging that government officials colluded with a supplier to purchase and accept substandard, unbranded bicycles instead of the specified branded ones, causing a significant financial loss to the state.

#### **5. Description of Events**
<p>The "साइकल काण्ड" revolves around corruption in Madhesh Province's flagship social program, 'Beti Padhau, Beti Bachao', which aimed to distribute free bicycles to female students to encourage their education. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched an investigation following complaints of irregularities in the procurement process during the fiscal year 2020-2021.</p>
<p>The core of the allegation was that officials deliberately violated public procurement laws. According to the CIAA, the tender agreement specified the procurement of <strong>'Ambika' brand</strong> bicycles, but the supplier, Om Satya Sai Pvt. Ltd., delivered unbranded, substandard bicycles which were assembled locally. Despite this discrepancy, officials accepted the delivery and approved payments.</p>
<p>The CIAA's investigation highlighted several key issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In one procurement phase for 10,000 bicycles, a bid from an unqualified firm was accepted.</li>
    <li>In another phase for 17,000 bicycles, unbranded and poor-quality cycles were accepted instead of the specified brand.</li>
    <li>The price paid per bicycle was inconsistent and inflated, with one batch costing NPR 6,432 per unit and another costing NPR 8,446.</li>
</ul>
<p>On August 3, 2022, the CIAA filed a charge sheet at the Special Court against 10 individuals. The primary accused was Yam Prasad Bhusal, the then-provincial secretary who held the authority for the procurement. The total corruption amount claimed by the CIAA was <strong>NPR 103,300,758</strong>. The case implicated members of the bid evaluation committee, storekeepers, and the managing director of the supplying company. Though the program was launched by Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut, who publicly defended the procurement and challenged the CIAA's findings, he was not named as a defendant in the case.</p>
<p>On January 26, 2024, the Special Court issued its final verdict. It found then-Secretary Yam Prasad Bhusal and then-CDE Bhagawan Jha guilty. Bhusal was held responsible for breaching the Public Procurement Act, and Jha was implicated for improperly recommending payment without a proper inspection report. However, they received a lenient sentence of three months in jail and a NPR 10,000 fine each. The court acquitted the other five officials and the supplier, Renu Agarwal.</p>

#### **7. Unverified Information**
*The initial case file provided for this research mentioned a loss amount of "१८ करोड" (18 Crore). However, all subsequent, credible media reports and official statements from the CIAA cite a corruption figure of approximately **10.33 Crore NPR**. The 18 Crore figure could not be independently verified and appears to be inaccurate.*
