  "title": "Cycle Procurement Corruption in Madhesh Province ('साइकल काण्ड')",
  "description": "<p>The case involves significant corruption in the procurement of bicycles under the <strong>‘Beti Padhau, Beti Bachao’ (Educate a Daughter, Save a Daughter)</strong> program initiated by the Madhesh Province government during the fiscal year 2020/2021. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) investigated irregularities after receiving complaints that government officials colluded with a supplier to purchase and accept substandard goods.</p><p>The core allegation was that officials at the Office of the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers (OCMCM) violated public procurement laws. The tender agreement specified the procurement of <strong>'Ambika' brand</strong> bicycles. However, the supplier, <strong>Om Satya Sai Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, delivered unbranded, locally assembled, and poor-quality bicycles. Despite this clear violation, officials, including members of the bid evaluation committee and the provincial secretary, accepted the delivery and approved payments, causing a financial loss to the state amounting to <strong>NPR 103,300,758</strong>.</p><p>Following a raid on the Chief Minister's office on October 13, 2021, the CIAA gathered evidence and filed a formal corruption case at the Special Court on August 3, 2022. The case implicated eight government officials and the supplier's director. The accused included:</p><ul><li>Yam Prasad Bhusal (then-Provincial Secretary)</li><li>Dilip Kumar Pradhan (Under Secretary and bid evaluation committee chairman)</li><li>Bhagawan Jha (Chief Divisional Engineer and evaluation committee member)</li><li>Other officials from the OCMCM</li><li>Renu Agarwal (Managing Director of Om Satya Sai Pvt. Ltd.)</li></ul><p>On January 26, 2024, the Special Court delivered its verdict. It convicted then-Secretary <strong>Yam Prasad Bhusal</strong> and Chief Divisional Engineer <strong>Bhagawan Jha</strong> for their roles in breaching procurement rules and recommending payment without proper inspection, respectively. They were sentenced to three months imprisonment and a fine of NPR 10,000 each. The remaining eight accused, including the supplier, were acquitted of the primary corruption charges.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Some initial reports and case files mentioned a total corruption amount of <strong>\"१८ करोड\" (18 Crore NPR)</strong>. However, this figure could not be verified in subsequent official documents or credible media reports. The official charge sheet filed by the CIAA and widely reported during the trial specifies the alleged corruption amount as approximately <strong>10.33 Crore NPR</strong>. The 18 Crore figure appears to be inaccurate or related to a different calculation that was not pursued in the final charge sheet.</p>",
