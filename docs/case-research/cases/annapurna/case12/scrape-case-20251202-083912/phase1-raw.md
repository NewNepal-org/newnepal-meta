### Unverified Information
<p>The initial document provided for this research contained a loss amount of "१२ अर्व" (12 Arba or 12 Billion Nepali Rupees). This figure is vastly different from the amount reported in multiple credible news sources, which consistently state the embezzled amount to be around <strong>NPR 24.8 Crore</strong> (248 Million). The "12 Arba" figure appears to be incorrect.</p>
<p>There is a discrepancy in the total penalty amount sought by the CIAA. Most English-language sources state the total embezzlement was ~NPR 248 million. However, a Nepali-language source reports the total claimed penalty (बिगो) as over <strong>NPR 66 Crore</strong>. This may be due to the inclusion of fines and penalties in addition to the principal amount.</p>
