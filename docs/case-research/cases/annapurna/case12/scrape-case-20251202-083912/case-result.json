  "title": "Corruption in Procurement of Mobile Laboratory Vans for Prime Minister Agriculture Modernization Project",
  "description": "<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against 13 individuals, including high-ranking government officials and a private supplier, for financial irregularities in the procurement of four mobile laboratory vans for the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernization Project. The charge sheet was filed at the Special Court on <strong>June 20, 2019</strong>.</p><p>The core allegation is that officials from the <strong>Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC)</strong> and the <strong>PM Agriculture Modernization Project</strong> colluded with the supplier, <strong>Prudent Meditech International</strong>, to embezzle state funds. The CIAA alleges that the procured vans were sub-standard, did not meet the specifications outlined in the tender documents, and that the procurement process violated public procurement laws.</p><p>Key issues highlighted by the investigation include:</p><ul><li><strong>Breach of Procurement Law:</strong> The accused officials are charged with flouting public procurement regulations to favor the supplier.</li><li><strong>Sub-standard Equipment:</strong> The mobile vans and their equipment were found to be of inferior quality and did not match the required technical specifications.</li><li><strong>Ignoring Technical Advice:</strong> The CIAA stated that suggestions from a technical committee were deliberately ignored to facilitate the corrupt deal.</li><li><strong>Improper Payments:</strong> Payments were allegedly released without proper verification or registration of the assets.</li></ul><p>The CIAA is seeking to recover approximately <strong>NPR 248 million</strong> in embezzled funds and has charged the individuals under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are discrepancies regarding the total financial figures involved in the case.</p><ul><li>An initial raw research note mentioned a loss of '१२ अर्व' (12 Arba or 12 Billion Nepali Rupees), but this figure is drastically higher than amounts reported in multiple credible news sources and is likely incorrect.</li><li>Most English-language news reports state the embezzled amount is approximately <strong>NPR 248 million</strong>.</li><li>However, at least one Nepali-language source (<a href=\"https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/social-affairs/134446-1561006500.html\">Nagarik News</a>) mentions a total claimed penalty (बिगो) of over <strong>NPR 660 million</strong> (66 Crore) from all defendants. This larger figure might include the principal amount plus additional fines and penalties as per the Prevention of Corruption Act.</li></ul>",
