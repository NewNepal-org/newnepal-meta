### **Description**

<p>The case against Lokman Singh Karki, the former Chief Commissioner of Nepal's anti-corruption body, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), involved two parallel processes: an impeachment motion in the Legislature-Parliament and a legal challenge to his appointment in the Supreme Court. Karki's tenure was highly controversial from its beginning on May 8, 2013, when he was appointed by the Constitutional Council headed by the then-Chairman of the Interim Council of Ministers, Khil Raj Regmi.</p>

<p>During his time as CIAA Chief, Karki faced widespread accusations of <strong>grossly abusing his authority</strong>. He was alleged to have run a "parallel government," using the CIAA to intimidate and threaten politicians, senior bureaucrats, and critics. Specific allegations included illegally interfering in the medical education sector to benefit his relatives, snubbing parliamentary committees, and using state resources to spy on opponents for blackmail.</p>

<p>On <strong>October 19, 2016 (2073 BS)</strong>, 157 lawmakers from the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) parties registered an impeachment motion against him, leading to his immediate suspension. The motion listed nine major charges, including contempt of parliament and court, overstepping his jurisdiction, and running the CIAA in an autocratic manner.</p>

<p>Concurrently, the Supreme Court reviewed a petition challenging the legality of Karki's original appointment. On <strong>January 8, 2017</strong>, a full bench of the Supreme Court delivered a landmark verdict, annulling Karki's appointment. The court ruled that he was ineligible for the position from the start because he lacked the required <strong>"high moral character"</strong> and did not meet the 20-year service experience criterion stipulated by the constitution. The court cited the Rayamajhi Commission's report, which had found Karki guilty of suppressing the 2006 People's Movement, as evidence of his poor moral standing. Following the Supreme Court's verdict, the impeachment motion in parliament was effectively stalled, as its primary goal—Karki's removal—had been achieved.</p>
