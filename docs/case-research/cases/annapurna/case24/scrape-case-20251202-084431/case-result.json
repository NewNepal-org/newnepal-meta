  "description": "<p>This case concerns the controversial tenure, impeachment, and eventual disqualification of <strong>Lokman Singh Karki</strong> as the Chief Commissioner of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), Nepal's primary anti-corruption body. Appointed on <strong>May 8, 2013</strong>, by the Constitutional Council chaired by Khil Raj Regmi, his appointment was contentious from the outset due to his past record.</p><p>During his tenure, Karki was widely accused of <strong>grossly abusing his authority</strong>. Allegations included running a 'parallel government' by intimidating politicians and bureaucrats, illegally interfering in the medical education sector to benefit relatives associated with KIST Medical College, and using the CIAA to settle personal scores. He was also accused of showing contempt for parliamentary committees and the judiciary.</p><p>The case culminated in two parallel actions:</p><ol><li><strong>Impeachment Motion:</strong> On <strong>October 19, 2016</strong>, 157 lawmakers from the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) registered an impeachment motion against him in the Legislature-Parliament, citing nine major charges, including overstepping jurisdiction and running the CIAA in an autocratic manner. This led to his immediate suspension.</li><li><strong>Supreme Court Verdict:</strong> Concurrently, the Supreme Court reviewed a petition challenging the legality of his appointment. On <strong>January 8, 2017</strong>, a full bench of the Supreme Court annulled Karki's appointment. The court ruled he was ineligible for the post from the beginning, stating he lacked the requisite <strong>'high moral character'</strong> (citing the Rayamajhi Commission's findings against him for suppressing the 2006 People's Movement) and did not meet the 20-year service experience criterion stipulated by the constitution.</li></ol><p>Following the Supreme Court's verdict which effectively removed him from office, the impeachment motion in parliament was rendered redundant and did not proceed to a vote.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>This section contains allegations and claims that were reported in the media or other secondary sources but were not officially substantiated by court verdicts or official investigation reports.</p><ul><li>There were media reports suggesting that India's external intelligence agency, <strong>R&AW (Research and Analysis Wing)</strong>, had influenced Nepali political leaders to secure Karki's appointment to the powerful post of CIAA Chief.</li><li>In a book published after the events, Durga Subedi, the husband of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, claimed that Lokman Singh Karki had attempted to offer a bribe of <strong>Rs 100 million</strong> to the then-Chief Justice to secure a favorable verdict in his appointment case.</li><li>It was widely alleged in news reports that Karki was using state resources to conduct surveillance and spy on political leaders, security chiefs, and his critics, potentially for the purpose of blackmail.</li><li>Rumors circulated that Karki was selectively pursuing corruption cases, targeting minor offenders while protecting influential individuals or 'big fish' in exchange for illicit benefits.</li></ul>",
