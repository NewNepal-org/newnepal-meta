  "title": "Bagheshwori Temple Guthi Land Irregularity",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the irregular transfer of <strong>84 bigha, 10 kattha, and 10 dhur</strong> of Guthi (trust) land belonging to the historic Bagheshwori Temple in Nepalgunj, Banke District. The land, classified as a 'Rajguthi' (state-controlled trust), was found to have been illegally converted to 'Raikar' (a form of private ownership) and registered in the names of approximately 300 private individuals.</p><p>The land is primarily located in the former Indrapur Village Development Committee (VDC) area, which now falls under Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolitan City, Janaki Rural Municipality, and Khajura Rural Municipality. The irregularity was first exposed publicly around 2019. Investigations revealed that the fraudulent transfers occurred based on decisions made around 1970-71 and 2000. Crucially, the official records ('misil') from the 1970s, which would clarify the legal basis for the land's conversion from Guthi to Raikar, are missing from government archives.</p><p>According to investigations, the land was first transferred to the names of the temple's priests (mahants), <strong>Chandan Nath Yogi and Harihar Nath Yogi</strong>, before being systematically sold off and subdivided. The individuals who acquired the land obtained official ownership certificates (lalpurja), and some have subsequently sold the property to others.</p><p>In response to public outcry, the government formed a high-level \"Public, Government and Guthi Land Protection-related Probe Commission\" led by former judge Mohan Raman Bhattarai. In December 2019, the commission submitted its report to the Prime Minister, confirming the irregularity. The report recommended that the 84 bigha of land be returned to the temple's Guthi and that those involved in the illegal transfer be prosecuted by an anti-corruption body. Despite these recommendations, the government has been slow to act, and the report has not been fully implemented. As a partial measure, the Land Revenue Office in Banke has frozen transactions for 17 bigha of the disputed land.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Initial information identified <strong>Chandan Nath Yogi and Harihar Nath Yogi</strong> as the main accused. News reports confirm they were temple priests and that the land was transferred to their names after its conversion to Raikar, before it was sold off to numerous individuals. </p><p>However, despite a high-level government commission recommending prosecution of those involved, extensive searches of public records and news archives did not yield any information about the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) or any other prosecuting body filing a formal corruption case against them or others in the Special Court. The Bhattarai Commission's report recommended that the 'competent authority for investigation of corruption' take up the case, but it is unclear if this has happened. The current legal status or whereabouts of Chandan Nath Yogi and Harihar Nath Yogi are unknown from the available sources.</p>",
