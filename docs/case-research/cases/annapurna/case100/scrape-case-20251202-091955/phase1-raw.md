### **Description**

<p>The Fake Bhutanese Refugee Scam is a high-profile corruption and organized crime case in Nepal where a sophisticated network of politicians, government officials, and middlemen are accused of defrauding hundreds of Nepali citizens. The perpetrators allegedly collected crores of rupees from victims with the false promise of resettling them in the United States as Bhutanese refugees. This was to be accomplished by creating forged documents to give them fake identities as asylum seekers.</p>

<p>The scheme involved creating a fake report, parallel to an official government task force's report, which was meant to find a permanent solution for the remaining Bhutanese refugees in Nepal. This fake report allegedly included the names of Nepali citizens who had paid significant sums of money. The case came to light after victims, who had paid amounts ranging from NPR 1 million to NPR 5 million, filed complaints when the promises failed to materialize. The initial complaint was filed on June 1, 2022, by 81 victims who alleged they had been cheated of Rs 130 million.</p>

<p>The investigation has revealed a deep-seated nexus between politicians, bureaucrats, and intermediaries, leading to the arrest of several high-profile individuals, including a former Deputy Prime Minister and a former Home Minister. The District Attorney's Office in Kathmandu has filed charges against the accused for treason, organized crime, fraud, and forgery.</p>
