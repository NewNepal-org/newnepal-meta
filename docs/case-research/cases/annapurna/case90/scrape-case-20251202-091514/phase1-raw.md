### **Case Details**

*   **case_id:** 90
*   **case_name:** Taragaon Development Committee Land Lease and Share Dilution
*   **summary:** The case involves allegations of irregularities in the leasing and transfer of over 300 ropani of government land belonging to the Taragaon Development Committee (TDC) to Taragaon Regency Hotels Ltd, the operator of Hyatt Regency Kathmandu. It also includes the systematic dilution of the government's share in the hotel company from an initial 39.77% to approximately 9.01%, causing significant financial loss to the state. Various parliamentary committees and government bodies have investigated the matter, finding evidence of malafide intent and illegal transfers, though a definitive resolution has been pending for decades.
*   **status:** Under investigation/disputed
*   **location:** Boudha, Kathmandu, Nepal

### **Description**

<p>The Taragaon controversy centers on a 1992 agreement between the government's Taragaon Development Committee (TDC), established in 1977 to promote tourism, and private investors for the development of a luxury hotel, now the Hyatt Regency Kathmandu. Under the deal, the TDC contributed a large tract of prime land in Boudha, Kathmandu.</p><p>The primary allegations are twofold:</p><p><strong>1. Irregular Land Transfer and Lease:</strong> In May 1994, 150 ropani of TDC's land was transferred to the ownership of the new joint venture company, Taragaon Regency Hotels Ltd. Later investigations by parliamentary committees deemed this transfer illegal, arguing that government land could not be converted into private ownership in this manner. An additional 148 ropani of land was leased to the hotel for 49 years, allegedly at rates not reflective of market value. Parliamentary committees have recommended that the 150 ropani be returned to state ownership and the lease agreement be revoked or revised.</p><p><strong>2. Dilution of Government Shareholding:</strong> The government, through the TDC, initially held a 39.77% stake in the hotel company. Over the years, through successive rights share issues in which the government did not participate, its ownership stake was drastically reduced. By 2014, the government's share had plummeted to just 9.01%. This dilution has been a central point of investigation, with allegations that it was a deliberate strategy by private partners to marginalize the government's stake and control of the valuable asset.</p><p>Multiple investigations have been conducted by the Public Accounts Committee (since 1993), the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the National Vigilance Centre (NVC), the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), and several sub-committees of the parliament's International Relations Committee. These investigations have often yielded conflicting conclusions. In 2019, a parliamentary sub-committee led by Agni Prasad Sapkota produced a detailed report confirming major irregularities and recommending the land be reclaimed. However, the CIAA decided not to file a formal corruption case later the same year, while the NVC's subsequent report recommended that the government take steps to protect the land and recover its share value.</p><p>As of September 2024, the dispute remains unresolved, with the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee launching a new study into the matter.</p>

### **Unverified Information**

*   The initial file's mention of the case year as "2072" (2015-2016 AD) and a loss of "35 ropani" is not directly substantiated by the broader investigation reports found. The main public investigations took place around 2019 (2075-2076 BS). The "35 ropani" may refer to a specific parcel within the larger disputed area or could be an inaccurate detail.
*   The names of the specific government officials who authorized the initial land transfer in 1994 and the officials at TDC who failed to subscribe to rights issues have been a subject of investigation, but they are not consistently named as formally accused individuals in the available public reports. A parliamentary sub-committee recommended taking action against the officials responsible for decreasing the government's share.
