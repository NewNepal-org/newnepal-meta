  "title": "Taragaon Development Committee Land Lease and Share Dilution Case",
  "description": "<p>The case involves allegations of significant irregularities in the leasing and transfer of approximately 304 ropani of government land belonging to the Taragaon Development Committee (TDC) to Taragaon Regency Hotels Ltd, the operator of Hyatt Regency Kathmandu. The controversy stems from a 1992 agreement to establish a luxury hotel as a public-private partnership.</p><p>The core issues are:</p><ol><li><strong>Illegal Land Transfer and Lease:</strong> In May 1994, 150 ropani of TDC's land in Boudha, Kathmandu, was transferred to the ownership of the joint venture company, Taragaon Regency Hotels Ltd. Parliamentary investigations later deemed this transfer illegal, stating that government land cannot be converted into private ownership in this manner. An additional 148 ropani were leased to the company for 49 years at rates alleged to be well below market value.</li><li><strong>Systematic Dilution of Government Shareholding:</strong> The government, through the TDC, initially held a <strong>39.77% stake</strong> in the hotel company. Over several years, through successive rights share issues in which the government did not participate, its ownership was drastically reduced. By 2014, the government's share had plummeted to just <strong>9.01%</strong>. This is alleged to have been a deliberate strategy by private partners to marginalize the state's interest and control over the valuable asset.</li></ol><p>Multiple investigations have been conducted by bodies including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the National Vigilance Centre (NVC), and several sub-committees of the parliament's International Relations Committee. A 2019 report by a parliamentary sub-committee led by Agni Prasad Sapkota confirmed major irregularities and recommended that the government reclaim the land. Despite these findings, the CIAA decided later that year not to file a formal corruption case. However, a subsequent NVC report contradicted the CIAA's conclusion, recommending the government take steps to protect the land and recover lost share value. The case remains unresolved and is under fresh review by a parliamentary committee as of September 2024.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Certain details from initial reports remain uncorroborated by later, more comprehensive investigations:</p><ul><li>An early reference to the case year as '2072' (2015-2016 AD) and a loss of '35 ropani' is not substantiated in the main reports from 2019, which focus on the entire 304 ropani land parcel. The '35 ropani' might refer to a specific sub-parcel or could be an inaccurate detail.</li><li>The specific government officials who authorized the initial land transfer in 1994, and the TDC board members who made decisions not to subscribe to rights share issues, have been subject to investigation. However, their names are not consistently listed as formally accused individuals in publicly available reports, although parliamentary committees have recommended taking action against those responsible.</li></ul>",
