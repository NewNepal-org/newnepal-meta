### **Description**
<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case on June 8, 2025, against 18 individuals connected to Nepal Telecom (NT), including its former Managing Director, <strong>Sunil Paudel</strong>, and the current MD, <strong>Sangita Pahadi</strong>. The case revolves around alleged irregularities in the contract for NT's billing system, specifically the <strong>Convergent Real-Time Billing and Customer Support Billing System</strong>. This system is critical as it integrates the billing for various services, including GSM mobile, fibre internet, leased lines, and broadband services.</p>

<p>The core of the allegation is that the accused colluded to cause financial loss to the state-owned Nepal Telecom. In December 2022, a contract worth approximately <strong>NRs 3.15 billion</strong> was awarded to the Chinese firm <strong>Asia Info Linkage Technologies (China) Inc.</strong> The CIAA contends that instead of issuing a competitive tender for a new billing system, the NT board decided in January 2023 to extend the Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) with the existing vendor, Asia Info, for four to five years. This decision was allegedly made in "bad faith" and involved setting "unnatural price rates" for the service. The action was taken despite a previous supplier having offered a 5% discount on the service.</p>

<p>The CIAA's chargesheet states that this non-competitive contract extension led to misappropriation of public assets. The anti-graft body has sought to recover <strong>NRs 334.8 million</strong> in damages from the defendants, along with an additional <strong>NRs 98.8 million</strong> which it claims was a direct loss from the corrupt activities. Besides the top management, the case implicates a wide range of NT officials from technical, finance, and operations departments, as well as directors from the Chinese supplier and its local Nepali agent, Arniko International Pvt Ltd.</p>

<p>This case is one of several high-profile corruption cases filed against Sunil Paudel. He is already serving a nine-year prison sentence after being convicted in a separate case related to the procurement of the National Payment Gateway. He faces other charges related to illicit wealth accumulation and corrupt procurement activities during his tenure as the Executive Director of the National Information Technology Center (NITC).</p>

### **Unverified Information**
*   The initial `details.md` file mentioned an annual loss of "barshik 3 arba" (3 billion annually). However, news reports indicate the total contract value was NRs 3.15 billion over approximately five years, with an annual payment of around NRs 650 million. The claimed damages by the CIAA are significantly lower. The "3 arba" figure might be an exaggeration or a misunderstanding of the total contract value versus annual loss.
*   The `details.md` file listed the year as "2079". This corresponds to 2022/2023 in the Gregorian calendar. The contract was reportedly signed in December 2022 (Poush 2079), which aligns with this information, suggesting the year refers to the time of the alleged corrupt act (contract signing) rather than the filing of the case (2025/2082).
*   The initial file mentioned a "कमसल प्रणाली" (substandard system). The CIAA's case focuses more on financial irregularities, non-competitive bidding, and inflated pricing rather than the technical quality of the system itself.
