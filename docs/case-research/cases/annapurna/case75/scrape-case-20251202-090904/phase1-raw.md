## Raw Findings: Swargadwari Ashram Land Dispute

Based on the initial information provided and extensive research from public sources, the case "स्वर्गद्वारीको जग्गा" (Swargadwari's land) is not a single incident but a complex, multi-decade issue involving land seizure, encroachment, and a dispute over tenant rights. The initial details regarding the year (1982) and the loss figure (958) appear to be inaccurate or misinterpreted.

Here is a comprehensive extraction of all available information.

### 1. Case Description, Allegations, and Facts
<p>The case concerns large tracts of land belonging to the Swargadwari Ashram Guthi (Trust), a major religious site in Pyuthan, Nepal. While the main ashram is in Pyuthan, it owns over 1,000 bigha of valuable agricultural land in Dang district, which is its primary source of income for funding religious activities, including a Sanskrit school and the care of hundreds of cattle.</p>
<p>The dispute is multifaceted and involves several distinct groups and actions:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Historical Seizure by Maoists:</strong> During the CPN-Maoist insurgency (1996-2006), Maoist cadres seized land belonging to the Ashram. As of October 2008, after the formation of a Maoist-led government, this land had still not been returned, despite promises to do so.</li>
    <li><strong>Encroachment by "Land Mafia":</strong> A significant portion of the land, particularly in the Lamahi and Ghorahi areas of Dang, has been illegally encroached upon by individuals and groups described as "land mafia" (भूमाफिया) and "middlemen" (बिचौलिया). These encroachers have constructed large, permanent buildings on the Ashram's land. Ashram officials claim these individuals have political backing, which has prevented authorities from demolishing the illegal structures. The number of such encroachers was estimated to be over 800 at one point.</li>
    <li><strong>Tenant Farmer Dispute:</strong> A large number of tenant farmers have been tilling the Ashram's land for generations. Since approximately 2065 BS (2008/2009 AD), the majority of these farmers have stopped paying "Kut" (rent in the form of crops or cash) to the Ashram. These farmers, now numbering over 3,500 households, have organized under the "Swargadwari Guthi Tenants Farmers Struggle Committee" to demand legal ownership of the land they cultivate. This has led to large-scale protests, most recently in February-March and September 2024.</li>
</ol>
<p>A key legal point in the dispute is a <strong>2006 Supreme Court mandamus order</strong> which declared that the Swargadwari Guthi is a private trust with specific characteristics, and its land, therefore, cannot be legally fragmented or divided. This order directly conflicts with the tenant farmers' demands for ownership. In 2019, the Ashram also expressed fears it would lose its land under a proposed Guthi Bill, which was later withdrawn by the government.</p>
