  "title": "Swargadwari Ashram Land Encroachment and Dispute",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns a long-running and complex dispute over large tracts of land owned by the <strong>Swargadwari Ashram Guthi</strong>, a major religious trust based in Pyuthan with significant landholdings in Dang district. The land, totaling over 1,000 bigha in Dang, is the primary source of income for the ashram's religious and charitable activities. The dispute is multifaceted and involves several distinct issues that have evolved over decades.</p><p>The key facets of the dispute are:</p><ol><li><strong>Historical Seizure by Maoists:</strong> During the CPN-Maoist insurgency (1996-2006), cadres seized land belonging to the Ashram. Despite promises made after the conflict, reports from as late as 2008 indicated this land had not been returned.</li><li><strong>Encroachment by 'Land Mafia':</strong> A significant portion of the land, particularly in the Lamahi and Ghorahi areas of Dang, has been illegally occupied by organized groups described as 'land mafia' (भूमाफिया). These groups have constructed permanent buildings on the trust's land, allegedly with political protection that has prevented authorities from taking action. Estimates on the number of encroachers have exceeded 800 individuals.</li><li><strong>Tenant Farmer Dispute:</strong> Since approximately 2008 (2065 BS), the majority of tenant farmers cultivating the ashram's land have stopped paying their rent (known as 'Kut'). These farmers, now numbering over 3,500 households and organized as the 'Swargadwari Guthi Tenants Farmers Struggle Committee', are demanding legal ownership of the land they till. This has led to large-scale, recurring protests.</li></ol><p>A critical legal aspect of the case is a <strong>2006 Supreme Court mandamus order</strong> which declared that Swargadwari Guthi is a private trust and its land cannot be legally fragmented or divided. This court order is in direct conflict with the demands of the tenant farmers for ownership rights.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<ul><li>The specific identities of the individuals described as the 'land mafia' and the political figures or parties allegedly providing them with protection are not publicly documented in available sources.</li><li>The initial raw research note mentioning the year '1982' appears to be incorrect. The land seizure and encroachment issues escalated significantly during the Maoist insurgency (1996-2006). The origin of the 1982 date is unknown.</li><li>Publicly available records do not indicate a formal investigation or case filed by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) specifically concerning the Swargadwari Ashram land. The matter has been handled primarily as a civil, political, and land rights dispute.</li></ul>",
