### **Case Summary**

The case involves allegations of corruption against the then-Mayor of Galyang Municipality, Bhupuraj Adhikari, and other municipal officials in relation to a ginger farming program during the fiscal year 2075/076 (approximately 2018-2019 AD). The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a case at the Special Court in Kathmandu, accusing the officials of causing a loss of over NPR 2 crore to the municipality by inflating prices and procuring substandard ginger seeds. After a verdict from the Special Court, the CIAA has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.

### **Detailed Information**

#### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

The CIAA has put forward two primary allegations:

1.  **Price Inflation:**
    *   A committee for determining the rate of ginger seeds had recommended a price of **NPR 155 per kilogram**.
    *   However, then-Mayor Bhupuraj Adhikari is accused of unilaterally and without justifiable reason, increasing the rate by NPR 10, setting the final procurement price at **NPR 165 per kilogram**.
    *   This action was for the purchase of **130,000 kilograms** of ginger seeds, leading to an additional and unnecessary financial burden of **NPR 13,00,000** on Galyang Municipality.
    *   This act is claimed to have provided an illegal benefit to the supplier, Spook Traders Pvt. Ltd.

2.  **Procurement of Substandard Goods:**
    *   The accused officials are alleged to have purchased and approved payment for ginger seeds that were of poor quality and did not meet the required technical specifications.
    *   Crucially, the procurement was done **without any quality testing**.
    *   A total payment of **NPR 2,14,50,000** was made to the supplier for these substandard seeds.
    *   The CIAA claims this action was done with the malicious intent to cause an illegal loss to the municipality and provide an illicit gain to the supplier. The total loss under this allegation, after accounting for taxes and the separate amount related to price inflation, is calculated at **NPR 1,97,70,499**.
