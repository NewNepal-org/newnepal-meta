### **Case Details: Tribhuvan Park Land Lease**

**case_name:** Tribhuvan Park Land Lease
**case_id:** 99

**description:**
```html
<p>The case involves the illegal leasing of <strong>50 ropani of government-owned land</strong> within Tribhuvan Park, Thankot, by a non-governmental organization to a private company at a significantly undervalued rate. [4, 5, 6, 9] The park, spanning a total of 166 ropani, was under the care of the <strong>Shahid Smarak Prakriti Pratishthan (Martyr Memorial Nature Foundation)</strong>, an NGO registered with the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. [4, 9] This NGO unilaterally leased the prime land to a private entity without the necessary legal approval from the Government of Nepal's Council of Ministers, which holds the sole authority for leasing government land. [4, 9]</p>

<p>The issue came to light in May 2022, when the Bagmati Province Minister for Culture and Tourism, <strong>Dipendra Shrestha</strong>, inspected the park following its management being transferred to the provincial government. [4, 6, 9] He discovered the unauthorized 20-year lease agreement, which had been signed for the purpose of constructing a "fun park". [4, 5]</p>

<p>Key details of the controversial lease are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lessor:</strong> Shahid Smarak Prakriti Pratishthan (an NGO). [3, 8]</li>
    <li><strong>Lessee:</strong> Shree Excelsior Information Technology and Trade Concern Pvt. Ltd. [3, 4, 6, 8]</li>
    <li><strong>Leased Area:</strong> 50 ropani out of the park's total 166 ropani. [4, 5, 6]</li>
    <li><strong>Lease Rate:</strong> NPR 9,150 per ropani per month. [4, 5, 6]</li>
    <li><strong>Total Annual Rent:</strong> Approximately NPR 5.4 to 5.49 million. [3, 4, 5]</li>
    <li><strong>Lease Duration:</strong> 20 years. [3, 4, 8]</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the discovery, the Bagmati provincial government formed a high-level investigation committee led by Law Secretary Binod Kumar Bhattacharya. [3, 7] The committee concluded that the lease agreement was made without legal authority and recommended its immediate cancellation. [7] The minister announced his intention to forward the case to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) for a corruption probe. [7] The case has drawn comparisons to the Bhrikuti Mandap land lease scandal, which was also investigated by the CIAA. [4, 9] Further allegations include the lessee company failing to pay over NPR 3 crore in rent, and the Pratishthan not acting to terminate the contract despite this breach. [3]</p>
