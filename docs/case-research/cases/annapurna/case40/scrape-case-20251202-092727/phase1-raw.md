### Raw Findings Report: Dhobi Khola Encroachment Case

**Case:** Dhobi Khola Public Land Encroachment
**Issue:** Illegal encroachment and registration of public land along the Dhobi Khola corridor.
**Status:** Ongoing investigation and encroachment removal efforts by government bodies.

---

### **1. Description**

<p>The case involves the large-scale encroachment and illegal privatization of public land along the approximately 13-kilometer stretch of the Dhobi Khola (river) corridor, from Bhangal to the Bagmati Dobhan (confluence) in Kathmandu. Investigations by the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority (KVDA) revealed that significant parcels of government land, particularly "nadi ukas" land (areas left dry after a river changes course), have been illegally registered in the names of private individuals and businesses. This was allegedly accomplished through collusion between powerful individuals, businesspersons, and employees at the Land Revenue (Malpot) and Survey Offices.</p>

<p>Various official reports and notices cite different amounts of encroached land, ranging from approximately <strong>14 ropani</strong> to as much as <strong>186 ropani</strong>. One official has stated that up to <strong>3,000 ropani</strong> along the Dhobi Khola may have been illegally registered under private names. The encroachers reportedly include high-ranking officials and influential families who have built private residences and commercial structures on the public land. Government bodies, including the KVDA and Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), have initiated efforts to reclaim the land, issuing public notices and beginning demolition of illegal structures, though these actions have faced delays and resistance.</p>

<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has also been involved, filing separate corruption cases against land revenue and survey officials for similar fraudulent activities, such as illegally altering land maps in the same district.</p>

### **7. Unverified Information**

<p>The exact total amount of encroached land is inconsistent across various reports. While the initial information points to a specific case of <strong>15 ropani</strong>, official studies and notices mention larger, varying figures such as <strong>14 ropani</strong>, <strong>168 ropani</strong>, and <strong>186 ropani</strong>. An official from the KVDA has made a public statement claiming the total could be as high as <strong>3,000 ropani</strong>. The specific names of the "high-ranking" officials and influential families who have allegedly encroached upon the land are not yet publicly disclosed in the available documents. One report mentions a Supreme Court ruling in 2016 that controversially declared 36 ropani 6 anna of public land on the corridor belonged to a private individual, Ram Prasad Upadhyay Bhattarai, suggesting potential judicial or political influence.</p>
