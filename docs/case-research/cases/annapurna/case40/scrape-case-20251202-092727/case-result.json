  "title": "Illegal Encroachment and Registration of Dhobi Khola Public Land",
  "description": "<p>The case concerns the large-scale illegal encroachment and privatization of public land along the 13-kilometer Dhobi Khola (river) corridor in Kathmandu, stretching from Bhangal to the Bagmati Dobhan. Investigations by the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority (KVDA) revealed that significant portions of government-owned 'nadi ukas' land (land left dry after a river changes its course) were fraudulently registered under the names of private individuals and businesses.</p><p>This was allegedly achieved through <strong>collusion between influential individuals, businesspersons, and corrupt employees at the Land Revenue (Malpot) and Survey Offices</strong>. The original land surveys from 1964, 1985, and 1999 identified these areas as public property. However, subsequent manipulations of records and maps led to the illegal acquisition of this land.</p><p>Government bodies, including the KVDA and Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), have initiated actions to reclaim the land. These actions include:</p><ul><li>Issuing public notices demanding the removal of illegal structures.</li><li>Conducting detailed studies to identify the full extent of the encroachment.</li><li>Signing formal agreements to collaborate on clearing the corridor.</li><li>Beginning demolition of illegal structures built on the encroached public land.</li></ul><p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) is also involved, having filed separate but related corruption cases against survey officials for altering land maps in the same district, indicating a pattern of fraudulent activity.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The exact total area of encroached land remains inconsistent across various official reports and news articles. While some documents specify smaller, precise amounts, other figures are much larger, creating confusion about the scale of the issue. The reported amounts include:</p><ul><li><strong>13 ropani, 12 anna, 2 daam</strong> (approximately 14 ropani) identified in a specific KVDA report.</li><li><strong>15 ropani</strong> mentioned in an initial case file.</li><li><strong>168 ropani</strong> mentioned in a joint public notice by KMC and KVDA.</li><li><strong>186 ropani</strong> identified in a KVDA study.</li><li>A claim by a KVDA official that the total could be as high as <strong>3,000 ropani</strong>.</li></ul><p>Additionally, while reports mention that <strong>'high-ranking officials' and 'influential families'</strong> are among the encroachers, their specific names have not been publicly disclosed in the available documents. There is also a mention of a 2016 Supreme Court ruling that allegedly transferred 36 ropani 6 anna of public land along the corridor to a private individual named Ram Prasad Upadhyay Bhattarai, suggesting possible high-level influence over judicial processes.</p>",
