  "title": "Tukucha Khola Encroachment and Excavation Case",
  "description": "<p>The Tukucha Khola case involves a section of the Ikshumati stream, a tributary of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu, that was historically channelled underground and built over. The controversy escalated in 2022 when the <strong>Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC)</strong>, under the leadership of Mayor <strong>Balendra Shah</strong>, initiated an aggressive campaign to excavate and reclaim the 'lost' stream, which had disappeared from view between the Narayanhiti Palace Museum and Putalisadak.</p><p>The KMC's campaign, which began with a notice on July 28, 2022, and physical excavation on September 15, 2022, was based on the premise that the river and its banks are public land that had been illegally encroached upon. The city's primary goal was to restore the natural water flow, mitigate flood risks in areas like Hattisar, and create a public corridor.</p><p>The excavation and demolition efforts were met with strong legal opposition from property owners who hold legal land ownership certificates (Lal Purja) and building permits for the structures constructed over the covered stream. Multiple writ petitions were filed at the <strong>Patan High Court</strong>, leading to an interim order on September 18, 2022, to halt demolitions.</p><p>The case was further complicated when the <strong>Department of Archaeology (DOA)</strong>, on October 23, 2022, declared the underground brick tunnel channelling the river to be a heritage structure dating back to the Rana era (c. 1885-1901), making it over 100 years old and protecting it under the Ancient Monument Preservation Act, 1956. This finding barred the demolition of the tunnel itself.</p><p>On January 18, 2023, the Patan High Court delivered a landmark verdict that acknowledged two competing rights: <ul><li>It affirmed that the <strong>Tukucha is a river, not a sewer</strong>, and as such, it is public property.</li><li>However, it also upheld the rights of landowners, ruling that the state cannot demolish legally registered private property without following due process and providing <strong>fair compensation</strong>.</li></ul></p><p>The ruling effectively halted the KMC's campaign to unilaterally demolish the structures. Mayor Shah framed the verdict as a partial victory for establishing the stream's legal status as a river and vowed to initiate a formal legal process to acquire the land. The dispute remains ongoing, balancing urban development, private property rights, and heritage preservation.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<ul><li>The exact length of the concealed section of the Tukucha stream is estimated to be between <strong>450 and 500 meters</strong>.</li><li>It was reported that around <strong>21 separate writ petitions</strong> were filed at the Patan High Court by affected property owners against the KMC's actions.</li><li>The historical motive for covering the stream during the Rana period is believed to be for aesthetic and sanitation purposes, specifically to <strong>prevent flooding and foul smells</strong> from affecting newly constructed palaces, as suggested by the Department of Archaeology's study.</li></ul>",
