### Raw Findings: The Case of the Disappeared Tukucha Khola

#### **1. Case Overview**

The "Tukucha Khola गायव" (Disappeared Tukucha Stream) case concerns a 5.9-kilometer-long tributary of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu, historically known as Ikshumati. A significant portion of the stream, estimated to be between 450 and 500 meters, was built over and disappeared from public view in the central city area between the Narayanhiti Palace Museum and Putalisadak. The issue escalated in 2022 when the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), under Mayor Balendra (Balen) Shah, launched a campaign to excavate and reclaim the "lost" river, leading to major legal and heritage disputes.

The core conflict involves the KMC's assertion that the land is public property illegally encroached upon, versus the claims of landowners who hold legal titles and building permits for the structures built over the stream. The case is further complicated by a finding from the Department of Archaeology, which declared the underground structure channeling the river to be a historical artifact.

#### **2. Key Individuals and Entities**

*   **Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC):** The local government authority, led by Mayor Balen Shah, that initiated the excavation and demolition campaign to uncover the stream.
*   **Balendra Shah (Balen):** The Mayor of KMC and the main proponent of the "Find Tukucha" campaign, aiming to restore the river's natural course.
*   **Property/Business Owners:** Various individuals and businesses who own land and buildings over the concealed stream. They claim legal ownership with certificates and have challenged the KMC's actions in court.
    *   **President Travels and Tours Private Limited:** Represented by Bhola Bikram Thapa, this company filed a writ petition that led to the first court order halting demolitions.
    *   **Jai Nepal Cinema Hall:** The first major site where the KMC successfully excavated and found the buried river, located 15 feet underground.
    *   **Laxmi Bank:** A structure in Kamaladi that was also affected by the KMC's excavation drive.
    *   **Vishwa Prakash Sakh:** A petitioner who filed a writ at the High Court, leading to a verdict that protected private property rights.
*   **Patan High Court:** The judicial body that handled multiple writ petitions from property owners. It issued several orders, including interim injunctions against demolition and a final verdict acknowledging the Tukucha as a river but upholding the rights of private property owners.
*   **Department of Archaeology (DOA):** A government body that studied the underground structure. It concluded that the tunnel was a Rana-era heritage structure, over 100 years old, and recommended its preservation.
*   **Supreme Court of Nepal:** Issued a broader verdict on the conservation of Kathmandu's rivers, directing authorities to clear encroachments within 20 meters of riverbanks and implement other protective measures for the Tukucha and other rivers.

#### **3. Timeline of Events**

*   **c. 1885-1901 (Rana Period):** According to a Department of Archaeology study, the Tukucha stream was intentionally channeled into a covered brick tunnel. Bricks found were engraved with 'Shree 3 Bir', indicating construction during the reign of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher. The purpose was likely to prevent flooding and foul smells from affecting newly built palaces.
*   **June 7, 2009:** The KMC issued a public notice ordering the removal of all structures encroaching on the stream, but no significant action was taken.
*   **2019:** The KMC again initiated an effort to find the missing river by writing to the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority, but the initiative did not progress.
*   **July 28, 2022:** The new KMC leadership under Mayor Balen Shah issued a 35-day notice for the removal of encroachments on the Tukucha.
*   **August 30, 2022:** The KMC began its excavation campaign, starting on the premises of Jai Nepal Hall, but the initial dig was unsuccessful.
*   **September 15, 2022:** After a two-week pause and using a larger excavator, the KMC team dug 15 feet deep and successfully located the gushing water of the Tukucha stream flowing within concrete walls beneath the Jai Nepal Hall property.
*   **September 18, 2022:** Acting on a petition from President Travels and Tours, the Patan High Court, through Judge Dipendra Bahadur Bam, issued an interim order to halt the demolition of structures.
*   **September 19, 2022:** The KMC continued excavation on open land in the Hattisar area, stating it had not been officially served the court's order.
*   **September 21, 2022:** The Patan High Court issued a show-cause notice to the KMC. It was reported that around 21 separate writ petitions had been filed by affected parties.
*   **October 23, 2022:** The Department of Archaeology announced that its study, led by archaeologist Bhaskar Gyawali, concluded the underground tunnel covering the stream is a Rana-era structure and qualifies as an archaeological heritage site that should be preserved.
*   **January 18, 2023:** The Patan High Court (Judges Mahesh Sharma Paudyal and Rajya Laxmi Bajracharya) delivered a full verdict, ruling that:
    1.  Tukucha is a river, not a sewer, and as such is public/government property.
    2.  However, the buildings and land registered to individuals are private property. The state cannot demolish these structures without following due process and providing compensation.
*   **December 19, 2023:** In a separate case on river conservation, the Supreme Court issued a verdict (full text released later) directing authorities to clear riverbank settlements and construct reservoirs at the headwaters of the Tukucha, Bishnumati, and Dhobikhola rivers.
*   **August 9, 2024:** Mayor Balen Shah posted a video of a large sinkhole on a road in front of the KMC office, stating, "This is the road over Tukucha," to highlight the risks posed by the covered river.

#### **4. Allegations, Claims, and Key Findings**

*   **KMC's Position:** Mayor Balen Shah and the KMC maintain that the stream is public land that was illegally encroached upon. They argue that covering the natural flow poses a significant flood risk to surrounding areas and that their goal is to restore the river and create a public corridor. An official noted that while the city surveyed the area in 1976, it failed to mark the river, which allowed land transactions to proceed. After the High Court ruling, Mayor Shah stated the verdict was a partial victory as it affirmed Tukucha is a river, and announced the KMC would initiate the process to legally reclaim the land registered in individuals' names.
*   **Property Owners' Position:** Landowners argue that they possess legal land ownership certificates and have followed all necessary procedures, including obtaining building permits. They contend the KMC's actions amount to the illegal destruction of private property.
*   **Patan High Court's Verdict:** The court's final decision created a complex legal situation. It validated the river's status as public property but also protected the rights of the landowners, stating the government cannot interfere with their property without due process and compensation. The judgment noted, "the contention... that Tukucha is a sewer does not seem reasonable," but also stated the metropolis should not curtail citizens' rights.
*   **Department of Archaeology's Finding:** The DOA's study introduced a heritage preservation angle. It found that the underground tunnel is nearly 130 years old and was built with bricks marked from the era of Rana Prime Minister Bir Shumsher. Under Nepal's Ancient Monument Preservation Act (1956), any structure over 100 years old is considered archaeological heritage, barring its demolition. The KMC countered this by arguing that the heritage status proves the structure is public property, and therefore private buildings should not be on top of it.
*   **Physical State of the River:** In its visible sections, the Tukucha is heavily polluted and resembles an open sewer. Where it is underground, it flows through a man-made tunnel. The encroachment is believed to be the cause of flash floods in nearby city wards during monsoon season.

#### **5. Quotes**

*   **KMC Mayor Balen Shah (after court order):** "It has proven again that Tukucha is not a sewer, but Tukucha is a river. It has also declared the jurisprudence that rivers have natural rights and legal personality... There is a legal standard that the land on the river or stream, right, left, or above cannot be in the name of a particular person."
*   **Patan High Court Verdict:** "In the presence of Tukucha (Ichchumati) river and a tributary river of Bagmati, and with such a long flow, the contention taken by the learned legal professionals that Tukucha is a sewer does not seem reasonable."
*   **Department of Archaeology Report (as quoted by the court):** "At that time, Hattisar Palace, White Palace, and Red Palace on both sides of the river were built so that the art and architecture would not be flooded by Tukucha, and the river would not send a foul smell in the areas."
*   **Sunil Lamsal, KMC Mayor's Secretariat:** "It will be a mistake to call the Tukucha issue a failure. It is 100 per cent certain that the structures built along the Tukucha river will be demolished and cleared. It is just a matter of time."
