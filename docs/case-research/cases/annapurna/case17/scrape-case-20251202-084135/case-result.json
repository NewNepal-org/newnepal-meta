  "title": "Misappropriation and Corruption involving Pashupati Area Development Trust Land in Gothatar",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns two major issues involving <strong>534 ropani of land</strong> owned by the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) in Gothatar, Kageshwari Manohara Municipality, Kathmandu. The land has been subject to a long-standing illegal encroachment by squatters and was also the site of a significant corruption scandal related to illegal sand quarrying, which resulted in the conviction of high-level officials and contractors by the Supreme Court.</p><p><strong>1. Sand Quarrying Corruption Case:</strong></p><p>On January 23, 2015, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against nine individuals, including former PADT Member-Secretaries and Local Development Officers. They were accused of illegally awarding a contract for sand and soil excavation to <strong>CN Construction</strong>, causing a loss of approximately <strong>NPR 46 crore (460 million)</strong> to the state. The allegations included collusion, awarding the contract without due process, and allowing excavation beyond the permitted scope and without a proper Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).</p><p>While the Special Court acquitted seven officials in 2016, the CIAA appealed the decision. On <strong>January 23, 2024</strong>, the Supreme Court overturned the acquittal and convicted all nine defendants, imposing prison sentences and substantial fines. The convicted individuals include former PADT Member-Secretaries <strong>Nirmal Kuinkel</strong> and <strong>Sushil Nahata</strong>, who were each sentenced to six years in prison.</p><p><strong>2. Illegal Land Encroachment:</strong></p><p>The same 534-ropani plot has been continuously encroached upon for years by individuals claiming to be landless squatters (<em>sukumbasi</em>). The history of this dispute is contentious, marked by events such as a reported arson attack in 1998 on an official who opposed the settlement. The PADT has made numerous unsuccessful attempts to reclaim the land, including issuing public notices and attempting to clear illegal structures.</p><p>In early 2024, a renewed effort was launched under the direction of the Minister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, Sudan Kirati. The PADT began collaborating with the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), led by Mayor Balen Shah, to demarcate and remove all illegal structures. The PADT has designated this land for major development projects under its master plan, including a Pashupati Hindu University, a large cowshed (Gaushala), an Ayurveda dispensary, and a public park.</p>",

The original source URLs containing these incorrect future dates have been omitted in favor of verified sources.</p><ul><li>While the total land area is 534 ropani, the exact monetary value of the loss due to encroachment is not quantified, though land prices in the area are known to be extremely high.</li><li>The precise number of illegal structures or encroaching families is not consistently reported.</li><li>Details of the 1998 arson attack on the home of local official Sanobabu Chaapain are based on news reports recalling the history of the dispute and may require further primary verification.</li></ul>",
