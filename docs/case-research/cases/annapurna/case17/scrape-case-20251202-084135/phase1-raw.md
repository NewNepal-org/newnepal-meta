### **Case Details: Misappropriation of Pashupati Area Development Trust Land in Kageshwari Manohara**

This report details two interconnected cases of misappropriation involving 534 ropani of land owned by the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), a state-managed fund, located in Gothatar, Kageshwari Manohara Municipality-8, Kathmandu. The issues involve a long-standing, illegal encroachment by squatters and a major corruption scandal related to illegal sand quarrying on the same property.

### **Part 1: Illegal Encroachment by Squatters**

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>A large parcel of land, totaling <strong>534 ropani</strong> and owned by the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), has been subject to continuous and increasing encroachment by individuals claiming to be landless squatters (<em>sukumbasi</em>). This encroachment has been happening for many years, with one report mentioning a related arson attack in 1998 (2054 BS) on the house of a local official who opposed the settlement, indicating the long and contentious history of the dispute. The land, which is situated amidst a growing settlement, remains largely unprotected, making it a target for illegal occupation.</p>
<p>The PADT has made several attempts to reclaim the land. These efforts include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Issuing public notices for the removal of illegally constructed huts and sheds.</li>
    <li>Attempting to clear the area in March 2020 (Chaitra 2076 BS), which was unsuccessful.</li>
    <li>Issuing a 15-day ultimatum in February 2022 (Magh 2078 BS) for encroachers to vacate the premises.</li>
    <li>Using police and administrative force to remove new structures, though encroachers often return and rebuild.</li>
</ul>
<p>In January and February 2024, a more coordinated effort was initiated by the government. Sudan Kirati, the Minister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation and PADT Chairman, directed the Trust to collaborate with the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), led by Mayor Balen Shah, to identify, demarcate, and remove all illegal structures on PADT's encroached lands, including those in Kageshwari Manohara. PADT has designated this land for significant future projects under its master plan, including a Pashupati Hindu University, a large cowshed (Gaushala), an Ayurveda dispensary, an old-age home, and a public park.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Loss (Damage):</strong></p>
<p>The primary loss is the land itself, which is a valuable asset of the Trust. While a precise monetary value for the entire 534 ropani plot has not been cited in the reports, land prices in the Kageshwari Manohara area are known to be high and have been rising rapidly due to urbanization pressure in the Kathmandu Valley. One report from July 2023 mentioned that <strong>31 ropani</strong> of the plot were confirmed to be encroached upon.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline of Events (Encroachment):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1998 (2054 BS):</strong> The home of a newly elected local official, Sanobabu Chaapain, who opposed the encroachment on PADT land, was set on fire.</li>
    <li><strong>March 2020 (Chaitra 11, 2076 BS):</strong> PADT published a public notice to remove squatters, but no major action was taken, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
    <li><strong>August 28, 2021 (Bhadra 12, 2078 BS):</strong> Reports highlighted that encroachment was intensifying, with new huts being added, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown.</li>
    <li><strong>February 2, 2022 (Magh 19, 2078 BS):</strong> PADT issued another public notice, giving a 15-day deadline for the removal of all illegally built huts.</li>
    <li><strong>January 29, 2024 (Magh 15, 2080 BS):</strong> Minister Sudan Kirati instructed PADT officials to promptly clear all illegal structures from the Trust's land.</li>
    <li><strong>February 4, 2024:</strong> PADT, in collaboration with a technical team from KMC, began the process of identifying and demarcating encroached structures for removal.</li>
</ul>

### **Part 2: Sand Quarrying Corruption Case**

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>On the same 534-ropani Gothatar property, a major corruption case unfolded concerning the illegal awarding of a contract for sand and soil excavation. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) initiated a case on <strong>January 23, 2015</strong>, accusing nine individuals, including high-ranking PADT officials and public servants, of embezzling funds and causing a significant loss to the Trust.</p>
<p>The core allegations were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Awarding the sand mining contract to CN Construction (operated by Bacchuram Dahal) without following due process.</li>
    <li>Accepting proposals at artificially low rates for the excavated sand.</li>
    <li>Allowing excavation in areas not specified in the contract and for a longer duration than agreed upon.</li>
    <li>Operating without a proper Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).</li>
    <li>Collusion between PADT officials and Local Development Officers (LDOs) of the Kathmandu District Development Committee to facilitate the illegal activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The case went through a lengthy legal process. The Special Court initially acquitted seven of the accused officials in August 2016, convicting only the contractors. However, the CIAA appealed this verdict to the Supreme Court. On <strong>January 23, 2025 (Magh 9, 2081 BS)</strong>, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Kumar Regmi and Abdul Aziz Musalman overturned the Special Court's decision, convicting all nine defendants.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Loss (Damage):</strong></p>
<p>The total corruption amount was determined to be approximately <strong>46 crore NPR (NPR 460,000,000)</strong>. The initial claim filed by the CIAA in 2015 was for Rs 465.4 million. The Supreme Court verdict included specific fines and recovery amounts for each convicted individual.</p>
