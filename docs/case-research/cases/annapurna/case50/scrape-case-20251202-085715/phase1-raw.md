*   **April 23, 2003 (2060 BS):**
    *   Following an appeal, a two-member Supreme Court bench consisting of justices Krishna Kumar Barma and Baliram Kumar acquits Robinson.
    *   The stated reasons for the acquittal were "insufficient evidence" and procedural flaws by investigators.
    *   Robinson is released from Dilli Bajar Jail. A businessman, Chandeshwor Lama, was reportedly waiting for him with a car. Robinson leaves Nepal immediately after.
*   **April 24, 2003:** Robinson is arrested again in Dharan at the house of Rajan Bohora.
*   **Post-April 24, 2003:** Police hand Robinson over to Resham Lama, an associate of Chandeshwor Lama. Robinson is then brought to Kathmandu and subsequently flees the country.

    *   The acquittal becomes a major controversy, drawing scrutiny from the Nepal Bar Association, lawyers, and international drug enforcement agencies, including Interpol.
    *   Attorney General Sushil Pant files an application with the Supreme Court for a review of the case.
    *   The Royal Palace takes the unusual step of asking the Supreme Court for details about the verdict.
*   **Circa July-August 2004:** A three-member Judicial Investigation Committee, headed by Supreme Court Justice Min Bahadur Rayamajhi, submits its report on the controversial verdict. The report, which was not immediately made public, is said to have held both the court and the police responsible for the affair.

*   **December 2004:** Justice Baliram Kumar resigns.
*   **Post-December 2004:** A larger bench of the Supreme Court reverses the controversial acquittal decision made by justices Verma and Kumar.

### **Facts, Allegations, and Specific Details**

*   **The Crime:** Gordon William Robinson, described as a "notorious British drug trafficker" and "international drug-lord," was caught red-handed at Kathmandu's airport with 2.3 kg of heroin.
*   **Initial Conviction:** His initial conviction by a Special Court was based on his own confession of smuggling the drugs from Mumbai via the Sunauli border.
*   **The Controversial Acquittal:**
    *   The Supreme Court bench of Krishna Kumar Barma and Baliram Kumar acquitted Robinson despite his earlier confession and being caught in the act.
    *   The justices cited that "investigators had not followed procedures properly" as a reason for the acquittal.
    *   This decision was met with protest from the Nepal Bar Association and led to a formal request for a retrial.
    *   The acquittal was seen as a humiliation for Nepali police authorities and the Home Ministry in front of Interpol and demoralizing for anti-narcotic personnel.
*   **Allegations of Corruption and Collusion:**
    *   Unnamed sources cited in news reports suggested the acquittal had "all the hallmarks of corruption and an active drug mafia."
    *   A judicial probe committee report revealed that a businessman, Chandeshwor Lama, met with Robinson in Dilli Bajar jail as many as 25 times while he was in detention.
    *   The day before his release, Robinson allegedly told his associate Rajan Bohora, "You can't imagine how much money I have spent. I am going to be released tomorrow."
    *   After being re-arrested in Dharan, Robinson was reportedly released into the custody of Lama's associate, with a committee member stating the belief he was "taken to Kathmandu to settle a deal."
*   **Judicial Fallout:**
    *   Both justices involved in the acquittal, Krishna Kumar Barma and Baliram Kumar, resigned in the months following the controversy.
    *   The formation of a Judicial Investigation Committee headed by a sitting Supreme Court justice to probe a verdict from the same court was a significant development.
    *   A larger Supreme Court bench later overturned the acquittal, confirming the legal questions surrounding the original decision.
*   **Judicial Inconsistency:** Legal experts highlighted that Justice Barma had previously given a tough verdict in another drug case (a 15-year sentence for Rita Dahal for possessing 276g of brown sugar), making his dismissal of charges against Robinson seem contradictory.
