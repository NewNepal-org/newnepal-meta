  "title": "Gordon William Robinson (Rabinson Prakaran) Drug Case Acquittal Controversy",
  "description": "<p>The Gordon William Robinson case, known in Nepal as 'Rabinson Prakaran', centers on the controversial acquittal of a convicted British drug trafficker by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2003. Gordon William Robinson was initially arrested at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), Kathmandu, after being found with <strong>2.3 kg of heroin</strong> concealed in his shoe and luggage.</p><p>Following his arrest, Robinson confessed to smuggling the narcotics from Mumbai, India, to Nepal via the Sunauli border. A Special Court subsequently convicted him, sentencing him to <strong>17 years in prison and imposing a fine of Rs 1.7 million</strong>.</p><p>However, in a highly contentious decision on <strong>April 23, 2003</strong>, a two-member Supreme Court bench comprising Justices <strong>Krishna Kumar Barma</strong> and <strong>Baliram Kumar</strong> acquitted Robinson, citing 'insufficient evidence' and procedural flaws by investigators. Robinson was immediately released from Dilli Bajar Jail and reportedly left Nepal.</p><p>The acquittal sparked outrage among the legal community, including the Nepal Bar Association, and drew scrutiny from international bodies like Interpol. Key points of the controversy include:</p><ul><li><strong>Allegations of Corruption:</strong> Reports suggested deep-seated corruption, highlighting that a businessman, Chandeshwor Lama, had met Robinson in jail 25 times before his release.</li><li><strong>Judicial Investigation:</strong> The intense public pressure led to the formation of a judicial investigation committee, headed by Supreme Court Justice Min Bahadur Rayamajhi, to probe the verdict.</li><li><strong>Resignations:</strong> In the wake of the investigation and scandal, both justices involved in the acquittal, Krishna Kumar Barma and Baliram Kumar, resigned from their positions by late 2004.</li><li><strong>Verdict Overturned:</strong> A larger bench of the Supreme Court later reviewed the case and <strong>overturned the controversial acquittal</strong>, reaffirming the initial conviction.</li></ul><p>This case is a significant example of judicial corruption and the subsequent push for accountability within Nepal's legal system, highlighting the influence of criminal networks and the challenges in upholding the rule of law.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Certain details surrounding the case remain approximate or based on anecdotal reporting, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial Arrest Date:</strong> Robinson's initial arrest at Tribhuvan International Airport occurred around <strong>2002</strong>, but the exact date is not documented in the available sources.</li><li><strong>Drug Quantity Discrepancy:</strong> While most sources cite 2.3 kg of heroin, other reports mention 'over two kilograms of brown sugar' or 'three kg of heroin', indicating a minor inconsistency.</li><li><strong>Alleged Bribe Amount:</strong> The day before his release, Robinson allegedly told an associate, Rajan Bohora, \"You can't imagine how much money I have spent. I am going to be released tomorrow.\" The exact amount remains unknown.</li><li><strong>Motive for Post-Arrest Release:</strong> After being re-arrested in Dharan, Robinson was handed over to an associate of Chandeshwor Lama. A member of the judicial probe committee stated a belief that he was \"taken to Kathmandu to settle a deal,\" but this remains an unconfirmed motive.</li><li><strong>Unnamed Sources:</strong> Some reports attributed the acquittal to having \"all the hallmarks of corruption and an active drug mafia,\" citing unnamed sources.</li></ul>",
