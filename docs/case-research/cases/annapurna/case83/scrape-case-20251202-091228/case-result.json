  "title": "Alleged Forestry Corruption in Dhanusha involving Hem Bahadur Malla (c. 1986)",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns allegations of corruption against former minister <strong>Hem Bahadur Malla</strong> related to forestry activities in Dhanusha district, purported to have occurred around 2043 BS (c. 1986-1987 AD). The core allegation, originating from a single internal document, claims a financial loss of NPR 3,24,00,000.</p><p>However, extensive research of public records, news archives, and legal databases has yielded <strong>no corroborating evidence</strong> to support these specific claims. There is no public information about a corruption case from that period involving Hem Bahadur Malla, his alleged alias 'Shere of Dhanusha', or an associate named Sharada Malla.</p><p>Publicly available information, in contrast, portrays Hem Bahadur Malla as a respected public administrator, primarily known as the founder and leader of the Salt Trading Corporation. In recognition of his contributions, the 'Hem Bahadur Malla Samman' was established in 2059 BS (2002 AD) by the Nepal Public Administration Association and Salt Trading Corporation to honor excellence in public service. He passed away in 2057 BS (2000 AD).</p><p>It is worth noting that the Sagarnath Forest area has been the subject of other, more recent and unrelated corruption investigations, such as those involving illegal land encroachment by local officials in the 2020s.</p>",
