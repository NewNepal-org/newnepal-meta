#### **`description`**
<p>The case revolves around allegations of corruption against <strong>Hem Bahadur Malla</strong>, a former minister, in connection with forestry in Dhanusha district. The alleged corruption dates back to the year 2043 BS (c. 1986-1987 AD) and involves a financial loss of <strong>NPR 3,24,00,000</strong> (Three Crores and Twenty-Four Lakhs).</p><p>Despite extensive searches for corroborating evidence, no publicly available information from credible sources could be found to verify the specifics of this historical case. Online searches did not yield any documents, news reports, or legal records pertaining to a 2043 BS corruption charge against Hem Bahadur Malla concerning the Sagarnath Forest or any other forestry project. The searches also found no mention of his alleged alias, 'Shere of Dhanusha', or the involvement of Sharada Malla.</p><p>Publicly available information primarily highlights Hem Bahadur Malla's role as a respected administrator, particularly as the founder and leader of the Salt Trading Corporation. An annual award, the 'Hem Bahadur Malla Samman', was established in his memory in 2059 BS (2002 AD) to honor individuals for outstanding contributions to public administration and management. His death was in 2057 BS (2000 AD).</p><p>Separately, there are numerous recent and unrelated corruption cases concerning the Sagarnath Forest Development Project, with charges filed against local and provincial officials in the 2081 BS (c. 2024 AD) period for offenses like illegal land encroachment. However, these modern cases have no connection to Hem Bahadur Malla.</p>
