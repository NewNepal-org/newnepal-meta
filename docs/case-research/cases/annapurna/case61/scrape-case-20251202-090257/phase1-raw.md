### **2. Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

#### **Allegation of Inflated Cost**
<p>The central allegation is that Karnali Provincial Hospital procured an MRI machine at a significantly inflated price compared to a similar purchase by another government hospital. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Karnali Provincial Assembly initiated an investigation based on this discrepancy.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Karnali Provincial Hospital's Purchase:</strong> Agreed to procure a 3-Tesla MRI machine from East West Concern Pvt. Ltd. for <strong>NPR 297,166,792</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Civil Service Hospital (Kathmandu)'s Purchase:</strong> Procured a 3-Tesla MRI machine with similar specifications from the <strong>same supplier (East West Concern Pvt. Ltd.)</strong> for <strong>NPR 227.42 million</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Price Difference:</strong> The cost for Karnali Provincial Hospital was approximately <strong>NPR 70 million</strong> higher than for the Civil Service Hospital, sparking allegations of financial irregularity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Kabir Shahi, stated that an investigation was launched due to this price difference for equipment of the same quality, capacity, and from the same company. Both hospitals had prepared extensive technical specifications, with most points coinciding.</p>

#### **Official Complaints and Investigations**
<ul>
    <li><strong>Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Probe:</strong> In July 2025, the PAC of Karnali Province began a formal investigation into the procurement process. The current website for the PAC lists its members and its mandate to investigate financial discipline based on reports from the Auditor General.</li>
    <li><strong>CIAA Complaint:</strong> A formal complaint was registered at the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) office in Surkhet by journalist Rabi Kiran Hamal of Himalayan Message, demanding a thorough investigation and action against those found guilty.</li>
</ul>

#### **Current Status of the Machine**
<p>Despite the controversy, the procurement proceeded. In a press conference in January 2023, Hospital Director Dr. Dambar Khadka stated that the MRI machine was being set up and was expected to be operational by March 2023. A later report confirmed that the 3-Tesla (64-channel) MRI machine is now in operation at the hospital, ending the need for patients to travel outside Surkhet for MRI services.</p>

### **3. Key Individuals and Entities**

*   **Karnali Provincial Hospital:** The public hospital in Surkhet responsible for the procurement. The hospital's official website lists its services and contact information.
*   **Prof. Dr. Dambar Khadka:** The Director of Karnali Provincial Hospital. He was director during the hospital's upgrade to 500 beds and the initiation of its kidney transplant program. His home was destroyed in an arson attack in September 2025 during anti-corruption protests, though reports link the attack to his brother's political career rather than this specific case.
*   **East West Concern Pvt. Ltd.:** A major supplier of healthcare equipment in Nepal and the vendor for the MRI machine to both Karnali Provincial Hospital and Civil Service Hospital.
*   **Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Karnali Province:** The parliamentary body that first launched the investigation. Its members include Bindaman Bista (Chairman), Bhim Prakash Sharma, and Jivan Bahadur Shahi, among others.

### **4. Timeline of Events**

*   **2022-05-08:** Karnali Provincial Hospital published an invitation for electronic bids for the "Procurement of MRI 3.0 Tesla Machine with all standard Accessories" (IFB No. PH/Karnali/ICB-39/078-79).

### **5. Unverified Information & Investigation Status**

<p>While the initial allegations and investigations by the provincial Public Accounts Committee are documented, there is <strong>no publicly available information or official press release from the CIAA confirming the filing of a formal charge sheet</strong> at the Special Court in relation to this specific case. Extensive searches for a final decision, charge sheet, or concluding report from either the CIAA or the PAC have yielded no results.</p>
<p>This contrasts with other high-profile medical equipment procurement cases, such as the one at Rapti Academy of Health Sciences, where the CIAA has publicly announced filing a corruption case against 13 individuals.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current verifiable status is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An investigation was initiated by the Karnali Province Public Accounts Committee.</li>
    <li>A formal complaint was lodged with the CIAA.</li>
    <li>There is no public record of a prosecution or final adjudicative action having been taken by the CIAA as of the date of this report.</li>
</ul>
