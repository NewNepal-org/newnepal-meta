  "title": "Corruption Allegation in MRI Machine Procurement at Karnali Provincial Hospital",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns allegations of significant financial irregularity in the procurement of a 3-Tesla MRI machine by <strong>Karnali Provincial Hospital</strong> in Surkhet. The central allegation is that the hospital purchased the machine at a substantially inflated price compared to a similar procurement by another government entity from the same supplier.</p><p>The key points of the allegation are:</p><ul><li>Karnali Provincial Hospital agreed to procure a 3-Tesla MRI machine from <strong>East West Concern Pvt. Ltd.</strong> for <strong>NPR 297,166,792</strong>.</li><li>In contrast, the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu procured a machine with similar specifications from the same supplier for <strong>NPR 227.42 million</strong>.</li><li>This resulted in a price difference of approximately <strong>NPR 70 million (7 Crore)</strong>, prompting investigations into potential corruption.</li></ul><p>Following these allegations, the <strong>Public Accounts Committee (PAC)</strong> of the Karnali Provincial Assembly initiated a probe into the procurement process. Additionally, a formal complaint was registered at the Surkhet office of the <strong>Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)</strong> by a journalist, demanding a thorough investigation.</p><p>Despite the controversy, the procurement was completed, and the MRI machine is now reportedly operational at the hospital.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While a formal complaint was filed with the CIAA and an investigation was initiated by the provincial Public Accounts Committee (PAC), there is <strong>no publicly available information, press release, or charge sheet from the CIAA</strong> indicating that the case was prosecuted at the Special Court. The final outcome of the PAC's investigation is also not publicly known.</p><p>There is a significant date discrepancy in a key news source from The Nepali Post. While the article text cites the PAC investigation starting on July 1, 2025, the URL slug indicates a publication date of July 1, 2021. Both dates are logically inconsistent with the procurement timeline (tender in May 2022, complaint in April 2023). Due to this lack of a verifiable date, the PAC investigation event has been omitted from the formal timeline.</p><p>In an event described by news sources as happening in September 2025, the residence of Hospital Director Dr. Dambar Khadka was subject to an arson attack. However, contemporary reports suggest the attack was related to his brother's political career rather than being a direct consequence of this procurement case.</p><p>A report from Ratopati confirmed the MRI machine is operational, but a specific URL for this news report was not available.</p>",
