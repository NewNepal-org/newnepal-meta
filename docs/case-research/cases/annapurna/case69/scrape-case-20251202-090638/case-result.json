The bridge, which cost over NPR 50 million, was built in a location with no road access, connecting Jarebar of Gorkha Municipality-3 and Siranchok Rural Municipality-5.</p><p>The investigation was prompted by media reports and public complaints. The CIAA alleges that the officials colluded to change the project's location and name from the original plan, abused their authority, and caused a significant financial loss to the state. The total loss claimed by the CIAA is <strong>NPR 54,552,671</strong>.</p><p>The accused individuals are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ishworchand Marahatta:</strong> Then-Secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, Gandaki Province. He is the main accused, with the CIAA seeking the recovery of the full loss amount from him.</li><li><strong>Ram Kumar Shrestha:</strong> Then-Acting Director of the State Road Directorate, Gandaki Province. He is specifically accused of embezzling NPR 571,780 for the process of naming a non-existent road.</li><li><strong>Omraj Dhungana:</strong> Senior Division Engineer at the Infrastructure Development Office, Gorkha. He is accused of spending the project budget without obtaining necessary environmental permits from the forest department.</li></ul><p>The case was filed at the Special Court in Kathmandu.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>It was widely reported that the former Minister for Physical Infrastructure Development of Gandaki Province, <strong>Ramsharan Basnet</strong>, allegedly misused his authority to have the bridge constructed near his personal farm. While these reports triggered the investigation, the CIAA has not formally filed charges against him. He remains a person of interest in the case due to his alleged influence over the project's planning and location.</p>",
