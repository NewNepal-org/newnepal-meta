  "title": "Disproportionate Assets and Revenue Embezzlement Case of Madan Prasad Gupta",
  "description": "<p>Madan Prasad Gupta, a non-gazetted first-class officer (Nayab Subba), was convicted in multiple corruption cases primarily involving the embezzlement of government revenue and the illegal accumulation of disproportionate assets during his tenure at various Land Revenue Offices (LROs). The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) initiated a major investigation into his activities, culminating in several charges filed at the Special Court in Kathmandu.</p><p>The most significant case, filed on November 28, 2019, accused Gupta of amassing wealth illegally. Over his 29-year career, which began around 1990, his total assets were valued at <strong>NPR 19,36,00,000</strong>. However, his legitimate income from salary and other verifiable sources was calculated to be only <strong>NPR 4,54,00,000</strong>. The CIAA determined that he had illegally acquired assets worth <strong>NPR 14,81,00,000</strong>.</p><p>Gupta's method of corruption included:</p><ul><li>Collecting revenue from service seekers at the LRO but depositing only a partial amount into the government treasury, pocketing the difference.</li><li>Creating fraudulent records to conceal the embezzlement.</li><li>Abusing his authority to influence decisions on disputed public land in exchange for bribes.</li><li>Hiding his ill-gotten wealth by registering assets in the names of his wife, Rita Devi, and sons, Vicky Gupta and Rocky Gupta.</li></ul><p>On January 23, 2024, a Special Court bench found Madan Prasad Gupta guilty in seven separate corruption cases. He was sentenced to five years in prison. In one of the embezzlement cases, he was also ordered to pay a fine of NPR 4,754,000 and repay the embezzled amount of NPR 9,508,000.</p>",
