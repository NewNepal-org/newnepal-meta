  "description": "<p>This case concerns allegations of corruption and financial irregularities within the Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) related to an aircraft lease agreement with China Southwest Airlines around 1998-1999. The incident, known as the 'China Southwest Scandal' (चाइना साउथवेष्ट काण्ड), is listed among several significant corruption cases that have affected the state-owned airline over the years.</p><p>The central allegation is that an improper aircraft rental agreement resulted in a substantial financial loss to NAC, estimated at <strong>NPR 22 Crore</strong>. The deal occurred during a period when <strong>Bhim Rawal</strong> served as the Minister of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (1998-1999), placing the ministry in an oversight role. The primary individual accused in internal documents is identified as <strong>BK Man Singh</strong>.</p><p>Despite being cited as a notable scandal in public records like Wikipedia, detailed official reports, investigation outcomes from bodies like the CIAA, or contemporary news articles were not readily available in public domain searches. This case is distinct from the more recent, widely documented issues concerning Chinese-made MA60 and Y12 aircraft that Nepal Airlines acquired in the 2010s.</p>",
