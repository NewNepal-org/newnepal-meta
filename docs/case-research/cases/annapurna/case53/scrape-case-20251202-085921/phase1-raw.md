  "case_name": "Mini Tiller Procurement Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case at the Special Court in Kathmandu against five individuals, including then-Secretary of the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture, and Cooperatives of Lumbini Province, Baikuntha Adhikari. The case pertains to irregularities in the procurement of mini tillers for farmers during the fiscal year 2075/76 (2018-2019 AD). [2, 3]</p><p>The accused are charged with causing a total loss of <strong>NPR 4,337,500</strong> to the provincial government through a scheme involving the purchase of substandard equipment and fraudulent billing. [2, 3] The case was filed on <strong>April 19, 2022</strong> (2079/01/06 BS). [4]</p><p>The charges stem from the 'Agricultural Mechanization Program' run by the then-Province No. 5 (now Lumbini Province). The supplier, Aadhunik Krishi Kisan Sansar Pvt. Ltd., had an agreement to supply Indian-made mini tillers. However, the company allegedly distributed cheaper, lower-quality Chinese models while billing for the more expensive Indian ones. [2, 4] Specifically, the investigation found that instead of the agreed-upon equipment, 17 units of model KK-IC-300D and 12 units of model KK-IC-200P were purchased, leading to an illicit gain and a corresponding loss to the state of <strong>NPR 3,715,000</strong>. [2, 3]</p><p>Furthermore, the accused are alleged to have created fake invoices and processed duplicate payments for seven mini tillers, amounting to an additional fraudulent sum of <strong>NPR 622,500</strong>. [2, 3] The government officials, including Secretary Adhikari, Division Chief Gyawali, and Officer Ramjali, are accused of approving the payments without proper verification of documents or field inspection, indicating collusion with the supplier. [2, 3] At the time the case was filed, Baikuntha Adhikari was serving as the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Technology and Land Management for Lumbini Province and was automatically suspended upon the indictment. [2, 3]</p>",
