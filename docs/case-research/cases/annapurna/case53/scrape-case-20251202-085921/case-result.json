  "description": "<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case at the Special Court, Kathmandu, against five individuals, including Baikuntha Adhikari, the then-Secretary of the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture, and Cooperatives of Lumbini Province. The case, filed on <strong>April 19, 2022</strong>, concerns irregularities in the procurement of mini tillers for farmers during the fiscal year 2018-2019 (2075/76 BS).</p><p>The accused are charged with causing a total loss of <strong>NPR 4,337,500</strong> to the provincial government. The allegations center on the 'Agricultural Mechanization Program' run by the then-Province No. 5 (now Lumbini Province). The scheme involved two primary methods of fraud:</p><ul><li><strong>Substandard Equipment:</strong> The supplier, Aadhunik Krishi Kisan Sansar Pvt. Ltd., allegedly delivered cheaper, lower-quality Chinese mini tillers instead of the contracted Indian-made models. This substitution is reported to have caused a loss of <strong>NPR 3,715,000</strong>.</li><li><strong>Fraudulent Billing:</strong> The accused are also alleged to have created fake invoices and processed duplicate payments for seven mini tillers, misappropriating an additional <strong>NPR 622,500</strong>.</li></ul><p>Government officials, including Secretary Adhikari, Division Chief Shreedhar Gyawali, and Officer Mukesh Ramjali Nepali, are accused of approving payments without conducting proper verification of documents or field inspections, thereby indicating collusion with the supplier, Rajaram Tiwari. At the time the case was filed, Adhikari was serving as a Secretary in a different ministry within Lumbini Province and was automatically suspended upon indictment.</p>",
