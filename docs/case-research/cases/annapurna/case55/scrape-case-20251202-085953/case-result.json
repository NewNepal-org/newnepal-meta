  "title": "Sikta Irrigation Project Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>This case involves allegations of significant corruption and negligence in the construction of the main canal of the <strong>Sikta Irrigation Project</strong>, a designated National Pride Project in Banke District. The <strong>Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)</strong> filed a case at the Special Court on <strong>December 7, 2018</strong>, against 21 individuals, including former minister <strong>Bikram Pandey</strong>, the head of the contracting firm <strong>CTCE Kalika Construction JV</strong>.</p><p>The core allegation is that the defendants knowingly engaged in <strong>substandard construction</strong> using faulty designs and low-quality materials despite being aware of problematic soil conditions. Feasibility studies from as early as 1980 had identified the presence of 'dispersive soil,' which is highly erodible and unsuitable for canal construction without special measures. These warnings were allegedly ignored, leading to repeated collapses of the main canal during testing in <strong>June 2016</strong> and <strong>July 2018</strong>. The CIAA sought to recover a total of <strong>NPR 8.59 billion</strong> in damages.</p><p>On <strong>June 19, 2022</strong>, the Special Court acquitted all 21 defendants. The court ruled that the canal's collapse was due to unforeseen technical issues related to the dispersive soil, which it claimed the defendants were not aware of during the design and construction phases. The court classified the issue as a matter of civil liability rather than criminal corruption.</p><p>Disagreeing with the verdict, the CIAA filed an appeal at the Supreme Court on <strong>April 4, 2023</strong>. In January 2025, the Supreme Court accepted the appeal for a full judicial review, stating that the Special Court's decision was 'worth consideration' as evidence suggested the soil issues were previously documented. The case is currently sub-judice at the Supreme Court.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are slight variations in the total corruption amount cited across different news reports. While the CIAA charge-sheet specifies a claim of <strong>NPR 8.59 billion</strong>, some sources mention figures like 'over NPR 2 billion' or 'NPR 8.32 billion'.</p><p>Additionally, there is an unconfirmed allegation mentioned in one news report that the consulting company, <strong>ERMC-ITECO Nepal JV</strong>, may have used falsified curricula vitae (CVs) for its experts to secure the project's consultancy contract.</p>",
