Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the Sikta Irrigation Project corruption case.

### **Case ID: 55**
### **Case Name: Sikta Irrigation Project Corruption**

---

### **Description**
<p>This case concerns allegations of corruption and gross negligence in the construction of the main canal of the <strong>Sikta Irrigation Project</strong>, a national pride project in Banke District, Nepal. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a case at the Special Court on <strong>December 7, 2018</strong>, against 21 individuals, including former minister and contractor <strong>Bikram Pandey</strong>, head of Kalika Construction.</p>
<p>The core allegation is that the defendants engaged in substandard construction using faulty designs and low-quality materials, fully aware of the problematic soil conditions in the area. This led to the repeated collapse of the main canal during testing phases in <strong>June 2016</strong> and <strong>July 2018</strong>, causing a significant loss to the state. The CIAA argued that the presence of "dispersive" or "dissoluble" soil was known from feasibility studies as early as 1980 and 2004, but these warnings were ignored.</p>
<p>On <strong>June 19, 2022</strong>, the Special Court acquitted all 21 defendants. The court's verdict stated that the canal's collapse was due to the unforeseen technical issue of dispersive soil, which the defendants were not aware of during the design and construction phases, and thus did not constitute corruption. The court classified the issue as a potential civil offense rather than a criminal one.</p>
<p>The CIAA, disagreeing strongly with the verdict, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court on <strong>April 4, 2023</strong>. The anti-graft body maintained that the defendants knowingly ignored prior warnings about the soil, failed to conduct necessary tests, and should be held liable for the massive financial loss. In early 2025, the Supreme Court announced it would review the case, stating that the Special Court's decision was "worth consideration" as evidence suggested the soil issues were previously documented. The case is currently under review by the Supreme Court.</p>

### **Facts & Allegations**

<p><strong>Allegations by the CIAA:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Substandard Construction:</strong> The main canal was built using low-quality materials and faulty designs, compromising its structural integrity.</li>
    <li><strong>Negligence of Soil Conditions:</strong> The CIAA alleges that the project contractor, consultants, and officials deliberately ignored feasibility studies from <strong>1980 (by Lahmeyer International GMBH)</strong> and <strong>2004</strong>, which had identified the presence of "dispersive" or "dissoluble" soil that was highly erodible and unsuitable for the planned construction without special lining and preventive measures.</li>
    <li><strong>Design and Supervision Failures:</strong> The case argues there was a failure in the design phase and a lack of proper supervision by technicians, consultants (ERMC-ITECO Nepal JV), and the contractor (CTCE Kalika Construction JV).</li>
    <li><strong>Canal Collapses:</strong> The 45km main canal collapsed at multiple sections during testing periods. Key collapses occurred in <strong>June 2016</strong> and again in <strong>July 2018</strong> when tested with a water flow far below its design capacity. A government probe panel in August 2018 confirmed the collapses were due to issues with dissoluble soil.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Loss:</strong> The CIAA sought to recover a total of <strong>NPR 8.59 billion</strong> in damages from the accused. The specific claim against Bikram Pandey and then-Project Chief Ramesh Basnet was <strong>NPR 2,137,679,920</strong> each.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Special Court Verdict and Rationale:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>On <strong>June 19, 2022</strong>, a joint bench of the Special Court acquitted all 21 accused.</li>
    <li>The court's rationale was that the defendants were not aware of the specific "dispersive soil" characteristic during the project's design, contract agreement, and construction phases.</li>
    <li>The verdict attributed the canal's failure to this unforeseen soil property, thereby absolving the individuals of corruption charges and suggesting it was a matter of civil liability.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Supreme Court Appeal:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The CIAA filed an appeal at the Supreme Court on <strong>April 4, 2023</strong>, challenging the acquittal.</li>
    <li>The CIAA's appeal argues that the Special Court's verdict was flawed because prior technical reports had clearly indicated the soil risks, which were ignored.</li>
    <li>In a decision reported in January 2025, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Til Prasad Shrestha and Sunil Kumar Pokharel ordered a full judicial review of the Special Court's verdict, finding that there were sufficient grounds to re-examine the evidence and the defendants' liability. The court summoned the defendants for the review.</li>
</ul>

### **Unverified Info**
<p>There are slight variations in the total corruption amount cited across different news reports, with some mentioning "over NPR 2 billion", some "NPR 8.32 billion", others "more than eight billion rupees", and some a total of "8.59 billion". However, the specific amounts claimed from the key individuals like Bikram Pandey, Ramesh Basnet, Dilip Karki, and Saroj Pandit are more consistent in the charge-sheet details. One article mentions an allegation that the consulting company (ERMC) used falsified expert CVs to win the contract.</p>
