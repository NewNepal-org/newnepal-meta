  "title": "Nepal Airlines 2009 Airbus MoU Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns a corruption charge filed by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) against Sugat Ratna Kansakar, then Executive Chairman of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), and other officials. The charges stemmed from a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with Airbus on November 5, 2009, to procure one A320 and one A330 aircraft.</p><p>The primary allegation was that on November 6, 2009, Kansakar authorized the transfer of a <strong>non-refundable commitment fee of $750,000 (approx. 57.3 million NPR)</strong> to Airbus without the approval of the NAC board and without securing the necessary financial resources for the full purchase. The CIAA accused the officials of violating the Public Procurement Act and embezzling the funds sent as the commitment fee.</p><p>The case proceeded through the legal system:</p><ul><li>On December 25, 2010, the CIAA filed a formal case at the Special Court.</li><li>In February 2011, Kansakar was jailed after failing to post a demanded bail of Rs 60 million.</li><li>Airbus returned the $750,000 commitment fee to NAC in April 2011.</li><li>The Special Court acquitted all accused officials in 2012, with one of the grounds being that the state incurred no loss since the fee was returned.</li><li>The Supreme Court upheld this acquittal on April 25, 2013, bringing the case to a legal close.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that a separate global settlement by Airbus in 2020 revealed admissions of bribery related to later aircraft sales to Nepal, providing context to the company's dealings in the country but was not part of this specific 2009 case.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p><strong>Conflation with the Wide-Body Scandal:</strong> Early reports and discussions about corruption at NAC often conflate this 2009 case with a separate, later scandal involving the purchase of two wide-body A330 aircraft. The alleged loss of <strong>Rs 4.35 billion</strong> is associated with the wide-body deal, not this case, which only involved the temporary transfer of a $750,000 commitment fee.</p><p><strong>Discrepancy in Acquittal Date:</strong> There are minor discrepancies in media reports regarding the exact date of the Special Court's acquittal. While the Supreme Court decision confirms it happened, some sources cite April 2011, while others cite 2012. The 2012 date is used in the timeline as it aligns more logically with the 2013 Supreme Court appeal.</p>",
