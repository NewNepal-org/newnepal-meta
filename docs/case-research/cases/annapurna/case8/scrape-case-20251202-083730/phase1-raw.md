Here is the comprehensive extraction of all available information regarding the Nepal Airlines Corporation Airbus case of 2066 BS (2009 AD).

### **Case Summary**

The case revolves around a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2009 by Sugat Ratna Kansakar, then Executive Chairman of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), to procure Airbus aircraft. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) later filed a corruption case, alleging that Kansakar and other officials bypassed legal procedures and sent a commitment fee without securing financial resources or obtaining necessary board approval, potentially causing a loss to the state. The initial file provided by the user correctly identifies the main parties and the year but conflates the alleged loss amount from a later, separate Airbus scandal.

### **Detailed Findings**

#### **Description of Allegations**

<p>The core of the case dates back to November 2009, when Sugat Ratna Kansakar, in his capacity as the Executive Chairman of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Airbus at the Dubai Air Show. This MoU was for the purchase of one narrow-body A320 and one wide-body A330 aircraft. Following the MoU, on November 6, 2009, NAC sent a non-refundable commitment fee of <strong>$750,000 (approximately 57.3 million NPR at the time)</strong> to the European planemaker.</p><p>The primary allegations, which led to legal action by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), were that this payment was made improperly. Specifically, the CIAA's investigation concluded that the decision to send the money was made without the approval of the NAC board of directors and without having the necessary financial resources in place to complete the purchase. Kansakar was accused of flouting the Public Procurement Act and attempting to entrap the government into a deal worth over $258 million without prior authorization. The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also began investigating the deal on suspicion of fraud from its inception.</p><p>In December 2010, the CIAA filed a formal corruption case at the Special Court against Kansakar and five other NAC officials, accusing them of embezzling the Rs 57.3 million sent as the commitment fee.</p><p>It is important to note that a subsequent global settlement by Airbus in 2020 revealed that the company had paid bribes to secure aircraft deals in multiple countries, including Nepal. For the Nepal deal involving A320 jets, which was revived after this initial case, Airbus admitted to financial commitments "likely to qualify as bribery of a foreign public official," involving at least 340,000 euros paid to a third party to route to Nepali officials. This revelation occurred long after the conclusion of the 2009 case.</p>

#### **Unverified Information and Discrepancies**

*   <p><strong>Conflation with Wide-Body Scandal:</strong> The initial information provided noted a loss of <strong>"४ अर्व" (4 billion NPR)</strong>. This figure is not associated with the 2009 case. It originates from a separate, later scandal involving the purchase of two wide-body A330 aircraft, where investigations by a parliamentary sub-committee alleged irregularities amounting to Rs 4.35 billion. Sugat Ratna Kansakar was also the central figure in that procurement after being reappointed as NAC's General Manager.</p>
*   <p><strong>Acquittal Date:</strong> There is a minor discrepancy in reporting. Some sources state the Special Court acquittal was in April 2011, while others, including reports that mention the subsequent Supreme Court decision, place the Special Court verdict in 2012.</p>
