  "title": "Financial Irregularities and Misconduct at B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences (BPKIHS)",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns a series of allegations of corruption, financial irregularities, and misconduct against the leadership of the B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences (BPKIHS) in Dharan, primarily centered around its Vice-Chancellor, <strong>Dr. Gyanendra Giri</strong>, and other key officials. The issues came to public attention around 2020 and culminated in major protests, government investigations, and legal action by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) starting in 2021.</p><p><strong>Initial Allegations and Protests (2020-2021)</strong></p><p>Allegations of mismanagement and corruption surfaced as early as October 2020, when the CIAA began a probe into the procurement of substandard ventilators for the BPKIHS COVID-19 hospital, which malfunctioned shortly after installation. <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/ciaa-launches-probe-into-irregularity-at-covid-19-hospital-of-bpkihs-dharan/\">Dr. Gyanendra Giri was accused in this matter.</a> By mid-2021, the situation had escalated dramatically, with faculties, students, and staff staging prolonged protests, demanding reform and an end to corruption. The protests, led by a \"Joint Struggle Committee,\" targeted four principal office-bearers whose resignations were demanded:</p><ul><li><strong>Dr. Gyanendra Giri</strong> (Vice-Chancellor)</li><li><strong>Dr. Guru Prasad Khanal</strong> (Rector)</li><li><strong>Dr. Mohanchandra Regmi</strong> (Registrar)</li><li><strong>Dr. Gaurishankar Shah</strong> (Hospital Director)</li></ul><p>The agitators alleged widespread financial irregularities in the procurement of medicines, equipment, and services, as well as political interference that deteriorated the institute's services. The protests included actions such as <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/bpkihs-sees-multiple-protests-as-it-faces-allegation-of-corruption-and-irregularities/\">seizing the officials' car keys and padlocking their offices.</a></p><p><strong>Investigations and Resignations (2021)</strong></p><p>In response to the escalating crisis, the government formed a high-level probe commission led by Secretary Baikuntha Aryal. The commission's report confirmed that there were <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-bpkihs-in-chaos\">\"massive irregularities\"</a> at the institute, implicating the office bearers. Following these findings and intense pressure, the CIAA raided BPKIHS on <strong>August 12, 2021</strong>, seizing documents related to purchases, construction, and other financial matters. Shortly after, on <strong>August 27, 2021</strong>, Registrar <strong>Dr. Mohanchandra Regmi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.khabarhub.com/2021/27/211753/\">resigned from his post</a>, stating it was to facilitate the government's investigation.</p><p><strong>CIAA Case: Falsifying Professorial Designation (2021-2024)</strong></p><p>A specific and significant allegation against <strong>Dr. Gyanendra Giri</strong> was that he was using the title of 'Professor' without holding the official position. On <strong>September 12, 2021</strong>, the Ministry of Health and Population officially stated that it <a href=\"https://english.makalukhabar.com/2021/09/12/evidence-found-that-giri-the-vice-chancellor-of-bp-is-not-a-professor/\">found no evidence of Dr. Giri being a professor</a> and that a legal process had been initiated. This led the CIAA to file a formal corruption case against Dr. Giri at the Special Court on <strong>January 23, 2023</strong>. The charge was for claiming a false designation with the intent to mislead, a crime under Section 15 of the Corruption Prevention Act-2002. Upon the filing of the case, Dr. Giri was <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/24/corruption-case-against-bpkihs-chief-for-falsifying-position\">automatically suspended from his post</a> as Vice-Chancellor. The CIAA also charged <strong>Dr. Gyanendra Man Singh Karki</strong> of Birat Medical College as an accomplice for allegedly providing Dr. Giri with the unauthorized professor title.</p><p>However, after a 13-month suspension, the Special Court <a href=\"https://english.makalukhabar.com/2024/02/29/dr-gyanendra-giri-reinstated-as-vice-chancellor-of-bpkihs-after-13-month-suspension/\">cleared Dr. Giri of the charges on <strong>February 29, 2024</strong></a>. He was subsequently reinstated as the Vice-Chancellor of BPKIHS to serve the remainder of his term.</p><p><i>It is noteworthy that BPKIHS has faced other corruption probes. In a separate case, former officials including ex-Vice-Chancellor Balbhadra Prasad Das were convicted in June 2023 for financial irregularities in procurement causing a loss of Rs 40.89 million.</i></p>",
  "unverified_info": "<ul><li>The initial case file mentions \"other hospital employees\" as being involved, but specific charges against a wider group of employees beyond the main office-bearers have not been detailed in the available sources.</li><li>Vice-Chancellor Giri's personal aide, <strong>Dilip Bhattarai</strong>, was accused alongside him in the initial ventilator procurement probe in 2020, but his role in subsequent investigations and charges is not clarified.</li><li>Protesters claimed that contracts for hospital buildings and the prices of procured medical equipment were several times higher than market prices, but specific amounts of loss for these claims were not finalized in the reports.</li></ul>",
