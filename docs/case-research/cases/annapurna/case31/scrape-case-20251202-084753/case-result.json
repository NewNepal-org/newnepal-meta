  "title": "Substandard Construction and Contract Termination of Tinkune Bridge",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the construction of an 85-metre arch bridge over the Bagmati River at Tinkune, Kathmandu. The contract was awarded to <strong>Pappu Construction Pral.</strong> in December 2014, with a total project value of Rs 210 million.</p><p>The project was plagued by significant delays and substandard work from the outset. A technical study conducted by the Department of Roads (DoR) on August 1, 2019, revealed that the construction was of poor quality and the bridge's foundation was unstable. Despite repeated warnings to dismantle and rebuild the faulty structure according to the approved design and engineering guidelines, the company failed to comply.</p><p>As a result of the persistent non-compliance and failure to meet quality standards, the Government of Nepal officially terminated the contract with Pappu Construction on <strong>November 19, 2019</strong>. At the time of termination, only about 25% of the work had been completed, for which the company had already received payments totaling Rs 60 million. The government seized the bank guarantee of Rs 27 million that Pappu Construction had deposited.</p><p>Following the termination, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) blacklisted the company in February 2020. In September 2021, the Kathmandu Valley Road Improvement Project issued a public notice demanding Pappu Construction pay a cash penalty of approximately <strong>Rs 50 million</strong> as compensation for breaching the contract.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Initial information may have conflated this case with another high-profile corruption case involving Pappu Construction concerning the Jabdighat Bridge in Bardiya. A reported loss figure of 'sadhe 21 karod' (21.5 crore or Rs 215 million) is very close to the total estimated project cost of the Tinkune Bridge (<strong>Rs 210 million or 21 crore</strong>). It is plausible that the 'loss' was informally equated with the total value of the failed project. However, no official document specifies a loss of exactly 21.5 crore for this case. The direct financial loss based on payments made to the company before termination was reported to be Rs 60 million (6 crore).</p>",
