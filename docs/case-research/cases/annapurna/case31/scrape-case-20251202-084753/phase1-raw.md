Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the case details provided.

Based on the research, the information in the provided file appears to conflate two separate, major issues involving Harinarayan Rauniyar and his company, Pappu Construction:
1.  **The Tinkune Bridge (Bagmati River, Kathmandu):** This case primarily involves extreme delays and substandard work leading to a contract termination around the year and project cost mentioned in the file.
2.  **The Jabdighat Bridge (Babai River, Bardiya):** This was a major corruption case filed by the CIAA due to the bridge collapsing before completion. It involves most of the known legal proceedings against Harinarayan Rauniyar for corruption.

The details for both are presented below for clarity.

### Case 1: Tinkune Bridge, Bagmati River, Kathmandu

*   **case_id:** 31
*   **case_name:** Substandard Construction and Contract Termination of Tinkune Bridge
*   **status:** Contract Terminated, Company Blacklisted and Fined
*   **description:** <p>This case concerns the construction of an 85-metre arch bridge over the Bagmati River at Tinkune, Kathmandu. The contract was awarded to <strong>Pappu Construction Pral.</strong> in December 2014. The project was plagued by significant delays and substandard work from the beginning. A technical study by the Department of Roads (DoR) on August 1, 2019, revealed that the work was of poor quality and the bridge's base was unstable. The construction company was repeatedly warned to dismantle and rebuild the structure according to the proper engineering guidelines and approved design but failed to comply.</p><p>Due to the failure to meet quality standards and complete the work, the government of Nepal officially terminated the contract with Pappu Construction on <strong>November 19, 2019 (corresponding to the Bikram Sambat year 2076)</strong>. Following the termination, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) blacklisted the company in February 2020. Subsequently, in September 2021, the Kathmandu Valley Road Improvement Project issued a public notice demanding Pappu Construction pay a cash penalty of approximately <strong>Rs 50 million</strong> as compensation for breaching the contract.</p><p>The Department of Roads seized the bank guarantee worth Rs 27 million that Pappu Construction had deposited. At the time of contract termination, only about 25% of the work was completed, for which the company had already received payments totaling <strong>Rs 60 million</strong>.</p>
*   **unverified_info:** <p>The initial file mentions a loss of "sadhe 21 karod" (21.5 crore). This figure is very close to the total estimated project cost of the Tinkune Bridge, which was <strong>Rs 210 million (21 crore)</strong>. It is plausible that the loss was equated with the total value of the failed project. However, no official document specifies a loss of exactly 21.5 crore. The direct payments made to the company before termination were reported to be 6 crore.</p>
