### **Description of Allegations**
<p>The core allegation, brought forward by the CIAA, was that Koshraj Wanta, during his tenure as Inspector General of the Armed Police Force, orchestrated a scheme to embezzle government funds. This was allegedly achieved by creating and approving payments for fake invoices from private transport companies for logistics and supplies that were never actually transported to APF units.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Wanta allegedly directed the accounts chief, Inspector Bin Bahadur Thapa, to process these fraudulent bills from <strong>Sadajyoti Transport</strong> and <strong>Aditi Transport</strong>. It was claimed that junior officers in the accounting department were instructed to prepare the false paperwork. This included a constable, Milan Adhikari, who was allegedly made to forge the signatures of officials from the stores (भण्डार शाखा) department to make the payment requests appear legitimate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CIAA accused DIG Arbind Dhital of obstructing the investigation. Dhital was the head of a 3-member internal APF inquiry committee tasked with looking into the matter. The CIAA alleged that this committee deliberately concealed facts and submitted a false report with the "intention of giving impunity" to Wanta.</p>
<p>During his interrogation in December 2015, Wanta reportedly admitted to his involvement in the fake bill scheme but claimed he was "provoked" into the act by unnamed colleagues. The significant bail of NPR 100 million (10 Crore) that he furnished within an hour was highlighted by CIAA officials at the time as an indicator of the vast properties he had amassed.</p>

### **Outcome**
<p>On July 1, 2019, the Special Court delivered a verdict of acquittal for Koshraj Wanta and all other co-accused former IGPs. The bench, led by Baburam Regmi, cleared them of all corruption charges. Some reports noted that acquittals in high-profile corruption cases were often due to weak investigations and charge sheets prepared by the CIAA.</p>

### **Unverified Information**
<ul>
    <li>The initial document for this case mentioned a loss of "१० करोड" (10 Crore), which is NPR 100 million. While this exact amount was furnished by Koshraj Wanta as bail, the official corruption claim filed by the CIAA in court was lower, cited as being between NPR 60.7 million and NPR 67.9 million by various news outlets. It is unconfirmed if the 10 Crore figure refers to the total estimated loss including other related cases or was an initial estimate that was later revised down.</li>
    <li>During his interrogation, Koshraj Wanta claimed he was "provoked by his colleagues" to commit the fraud, but he did not disclose their names. The identities of these alleged instigators remain unverified.</li>
