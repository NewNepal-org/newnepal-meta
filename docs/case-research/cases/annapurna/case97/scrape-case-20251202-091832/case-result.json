  "title": "APF Logistics Transport Fake Bills Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The case revolves around allegations that Koshraj Wanta, during his tenure as Inspector General (IG) of the Armed Police Force (APF), Nepal, masterminded a scheme to embezzle state funds. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) accused Wanta and several other APF officials and private suppliers of corruption between fiscal years 2012 and 2014.</p><p>The primary allegation was the systematic creation and approval of <strong>fake and forged invoices</strong> for the transportation of logistics and supplies to various APF units across the country. These services were allegedly never rendered. According to the CIAA's charge sheet filed on February 1, 2016, Wanta directed subordinates, including the accounts chief, to process fraudulent bills from private companies, namely <strong>Sadajyoti Transport</strong> and <strong>Aditi Transport</strong>. The scheme allegedly involved junior officers forging signatures to legitimize the payments.</p><p>The CIAA also accused then-Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Arbind Dhital of <strong>obstructing the investigation</strong>. Dhital led an internal APF inquiry that allegedly submitted a false report to the CIAA with the intent to protect Wanta and conceal the facts.</p><p>Following a recommendation from the CIAA, the government suspended Wanta on December 18, 2015. He was interrogated by the CIAA and released after posting a substantial bail of <strong>NPR 100,000,000</strong> (10 Crore).</p><p>Despite the allegations and the high-profile nature of the case, on July 1, 2019, the Special Court in Kathmandu acquitted Koshraj Wanta and all other co-accused. The verdict cited a lack of sufficient evidence to prove the corruption charges filed by the CIAA.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Several details surrounding the case remain unconfirmed or have conflicting reports:</p><ul><li><strong>Exact Embezzled Amount:</strong> While the CIAA filed a charge sheet, news outlets reported varying amounts, including NPR 67,941,706, NPR 66,941,000, and NPR 60,710,000. Some initial estimates suggested a total loss of over NPR 90 million. The precise figure claimed in the final court documents is not consistently reported across sources.</li><li><strong>Alleged 'Provocation':</strong> During his interrogation, Koshraj Wanta reportedly claimed he was 'provoked by his colleagues' to engage in the fraudulent activities. However, the identities of these individuals were never publicly disclosed or verified.</li><li><strong>Additional Suspensions:</strong> Initial CIAA recommendations for suspension reportedly included DSP Suman Jung Thapa and DSP Ram Krishna Maharjan, but their exact role and the final action taken against them are not clearly detailed in the available sources.</li></ul>",
