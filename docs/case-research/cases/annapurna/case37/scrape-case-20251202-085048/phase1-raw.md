## Tax Settlement Commission Corruption Case: Raw Findings

**Case Reference:** 37
**Subject:** Tax Settlement
**Issue:** Alleged illegal tax exemptions granted to various businesses.
**Year of Initial Allegation:** 2074 (Nepalese Calendar), corresponding to 2017/2018 AD.

### Main Individuals Accused:
*   **Chudamani Sharma:** Then Director General of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and Member-Secretary of the Tax Settlement Commission (TSC).
*   **Lumbadhoj Mahat:** Chairman of the Tax Settlement Commission (TSC).
*   **Umesh Prasad Dhakal:** Member of the Tax Settlement Commission (TSC).

### Allegations and Financial Discrepancies

The core allegation is that the three officials of the Tax Settlement Commission (TSC), formed in February 2015, abused their authority to provide massive, arbitrary, and illegal tax waivers to various businesses, causing significant loss to the state. The officials were accused of settling large tax liabilities with malafide intention for personal benefit.

There are significant discrepancies across various reports regarding the exact financial figures involved in the scandal:

*   **Initial Estimated Loss (Auditor General's Report):** The Office of the Auditor General's 2017 report first brought the issue to light, questioning tax exemptions amounting to over **Rs 21 billion** (or "21 arba"). The report stated that the TSC had settled Rs 30.52 billion in disputed taxes for only Rs 9.54 billion, thereby waiving nearly Rs 21 billion.
*   **Initial CIAA Corruption Case Filing:** The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed its first case in July 2017, accusing the trio of embezzling:
    *   **Rs 10.02 billion**.
    *   **Rs 10.96 billion**.
    *   "Nearly **Rs 11 billion**".
*   **Supplementary CIAA Case:** In June 2021, the CIAA filed an additional corruption case against the same three individuals, accusing them of embezzling a further **Rs 1.003 billion** (over Rs 1 billion). This second case was based on an investigation into tax waivers granted to 71 additional taxpayers not covered in the initial filing.
*   **Disproportionate Assets Case:** A separate case was filed against Chudamani Sharma and his wife, Kalpana Uprety Sharma, in January 2018 for amassing property worth **Rs 42.95 million** disproportionate to his known legal income. The Special Court later acquitted them of this charge.
*   **Special Court Conviction Amount & Fines:** In 2023, the Special Court convicted the three officials. The financial penalties imposed were reported with some variation:
    *   A fine of **Rs 4.1 billion** for each official.
    *   A total penalty of **Rs 6 billion** for Sharma.
    *   A total determined loss of **Rs 6.16 billion**, which formed the basis of the fines.

### Timeline of Events

*   **2015-02 (February):** The government, led by Sushil Koirala, formed a three-member Tax Settlement Commission (TSC) under the Tax Settlement Commission Act, 1976, to resolve disputed tax cases. Lumbadhoj Mahat was appointed Chairman, with Umesh Prasad Dhakal as a member and Chudamani Sharma (then Director General of the IRD) as member-secretary.
*   **2016-04 (April):** The Office of the Auditor General's report first raised red flags, questioning the TSC's decisions to grant exemptions amounting to over **Rs 21 billion**.
*   **2017-04-13:** The Auditor General's 54th annual report was officially released, publicly detailing the questionable tax settlements.
*   **2017-04-27:** The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Legislature-Parliament, acting on the Auditor General's report, directed the Ministry of Finance to submit the TSC's report for investigation.
*   **2017-06-02:** The CIAA arrested Chudamani Sharma on charges of corruption and misuse of authority. Mahat and Dhakal were reported to be absconding.
*   **2017-07-16:** The CIAA filed its first major corruption case at the Special Court against Sharma, Mahat, and Dhakal, accusing them of embezzling **Rs 10.02 billion**.
*   **2018-01-29:** The CIAA filed a second, separate corruption case against Chudamani Sharma and his wife, alleging the illegal accumulation of wealth amounting to **Rs 42.95 million**.
*   **2021-06-23:** The CIAA filed a supplementary corruption charge sheet against the trio at the Special Court, seeking to recover an additional **Rs 1.003 billion** related to tax waivers for 71 other enterprises.
*   **2023-06-01:** The Special Court, in a landmark decision, convicted all three former TSC officials—Chudamani Sharma, Lumbadhoj Mahat, and Umesh Prasad Dhakal—on charges of corruption in the tax exemption case. On the same day, the court acquitted Sharma and his wife in the disproportionate assets case.
*   **2023-06-20:** The Special Court announced the sentences for the convicted officials.
    *   **Lumbadhoj Mahat:** Sentenced to nine years and one month in prison.
    *   **Chudamani Sharma & Umesh Prasad Dhakal:** Sentenced to nine years in prison each.
    *   **Fines:** The court imposed heavy fines, reported as **Rs 4.1 billion each**, stemming from a determined loss of over Rs 6 billion.
*   **2025-07-09 (reported date):** The Supreme Court of Nepal annulled the Special Court's 2023 verdict. A division bench of Justices Sharanga Subedi and Tek Prasad Dhungana cited "grave legal flaws" and procedural errors, including the consultation of experts without informing the defendants, which violated the principles of natural justice and fair hearing. The Supreme Court ordered the case to be sent back to the **Special Court for a complete retrial**. Following this decision, the three accused were released from prison on general bail.
*   **2025-07-28 (reported date):** The three accused were summoned to appear before the Special Court as the retrial process began.

### Specific Allegations and Modus Operandi

The investigation by the CIAA and the report from the Auditor General highlighted several methods used to grant illegal tax exemptions:

*   **Waiving Value Added Tax (VAT):** The commission allegedly waived VAT liabilities for numerous companies. This was considered a major crime, as VAT is collected from customers on behalf of the government, and businesses are merely custodians of that money.
*   **Ignoring Legal Procedures:** The TSC settled tax disputes for companies that had not withdrawn their pending appeals from the Revenue Tribunal, a violation of the Tax Settlement Commission Act.
*   **Falsifying Reports:** The TSC members allegedly falsified their reports to the government, showing lower amounts of tax exemption than what was actually granted. For instance, Triveni Distillery was reported to have received a Rs 3.29 billion exemption, while the charge sheet claimed the actual amount was **Rs 4.01 billion**.
*   **Arbitrary Exemptions for Profitable Companies:** Tax exemptions were given to large, profitable corporations like Ncell, which was allegedly granted an exemption of over Rs 900 million on a Rs 1.82 billion tax bill without any concrete justification. Another example cited was Triveni Distillery, which allegedly had a tax liability of over Rs 3.3 billion settled for just Rs 39.9 million, a discount of nearly 99%.
*   **Returning Paid Taxes:** In some instances, the commission not only waived taxes but also made decisions that resulted in the state returning taxes that had already been paid by businesses through the self-declaration system.
