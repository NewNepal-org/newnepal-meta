  "title": "Tax Settlement Commission Corruption Case (2015-Ongoing)",
  "description": "<p>This case involves allegations of large-scale corruption against the members of the Tax Settlement Commission (TSC), which was formed in February 2015. The commission, consisting of Chairman <strong>Lumbadhoj Mahat</strong>, member <strong>Umesh Prasad Dhakal</strong>, and member-secretary <strong>Chudamani Sharma</strong> (then Director General of the Inland Revenue Department), was accused of abusing its authority to provide illegal and arbitrary tax exemptions to various businesses, causing a massive loss to the state exchequer.</p><p>The scandal first came to public attention through the 54th annual report of the Office of the Auditor General in April 2017, which flagged irregularities in tax settlements amounting to over Rs 21 billion. This prompted investigations by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).</p><p>The CIAA subsequently filed multiple corruption cases against the trio at the Special Court:</p><ul><li>A primary case in July 2017 for embezzling <strong>Rs 10.02 billion</strong>.</li><li>A supplementary case in June 2021 for embezzling an additional <strong>Rs 1.003 billion</strong> related to waivers for 71 other enterprises.</li><li>A separate case against Chudamani Sharma and his wife, Kalpana Uprety Sharma, for amassing disproportionate assets worth <strong>Rs 42.95 million</strong>.</li></ul><p>The investigation revealed a modus operandi that included waiving non-waivable taxes like VAT, settling cases for companies that had not followed legal procedures, falsifying reports to understate exemptions, and providing massive discounts to profitable corporations. For instance, Triveni Distillery allegedly had a tax liability of over Rs 3.3 billion settled for just Rs 39.9 million.</p><p>On June 1, 2023, the Special Court convicted Mahat, Dhakal, and Sharma in the main corruption case but acquitted Sharma and his wife in the disproportionate assets case. The three were sentenced to over nine years in prison and ordered to pay substantial fines. However, on July 9, 2024, the <strong>Supreme Court of Nepal annulled the Special Court's verdict</strong>, citing 'grave legal flaws' and violations of the principles of natural justice. The Supreme Court ordered a complete retrial by the Special Court, and the case remains ongoing.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are significant discrepancies across various official reports and news articles regarding the exact financial figures involved in the scandal. While the specific amounts filed by the CIAA are precise, the total loss to the state is reported with wide variations.</p><ul><li><strong>Total Alleged Loss:</strong> The Office of the Auditor General's initial report estimated that the state lost nearly <strong>Rs 21 billion</strong> (settling Rs 30.52 billion in disputed taxes for only Rs 9.54 billion).</li><li><strong>Initial CIAA Case Amount:</strong> News reports on the first case filing mentioned varying figures, including <strong>Rs 10.02 billion</strong>, <strong>Rs 10.96 billion</strong>, and 'nearly <strong>Rs 11 billion</strong>'. The official charge sheet amount was Rs 10.02 billion.</li><li><strong>Special Court Fines:</strong> Following the 2023 conviction, the fines were also reported with some confusion. Some sources reported a fine of <strong>Rs 4.1 billion</strong> for each official, while others mentioned a total penalty of <strong>Rs 6 billion</strong> specifically for Chudamani Sharma. The verdict was based on a determined loss of <strong>Rs 6.16 billion</strong>.</li></ul><p>These inconsistencies highlight the complexity of quantifying the total financial impact and the different figures used at various stages of the investigation and prosecution.</p>",
