### **Description**
<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case at the Special Court in Kathmandu against 12 individuals and one cooperative society concerning the misuse of a government grant. The case revolves around an agricultural subsidy of <strong>NPR 6,650,000</strong> provided by the Karnali Province Government to Simnath Krishi Vikas Sahakari Sanstha Ltd. in Kalikot for the establishment of a high-tech fruit nursery.</p>
<p>The core allegations state that the defendants colluded to embezzle the grant money without completing the project as per the agreement. The CIAA's investigation claimed that Bharat Bahadur Basnet, then-acting chief of the Agriculture Knowledge Center, along with engineer Sumit Bhatt and sub-engineer Gururaj Sanjyal, prepared a fraudulent feasibility report. This report allegedly recommended the project for a location that lacked the necessary electricity supply for a high-tech nursery. Furthermore, they were accused of preparing an inflated cost estimate and purchasing equipment at excessively high prices.</p>
<p>The prosecution claimed that these officials, in collusion with the evaluation committee and cooperative members, produced a false work completion report without proper on-site verification, leading to the wrongful disbursement of NPR 6,650,000. The CIAA charged that the evaluation committee members acted with bad faith by approving the flawed evaluation report and forwarding it to the provincial Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture, and Cooperatives. The cooperative's chairman and treasurer were accused of creating a false proposal, despite lacking the institutional financial capacity, and accepting the grant money without actually establishing the nursery.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2023, the Special Court, under a bench led by Chairperson Tek Narayan Kunwar with judges Ram Bahadur Thapa and Muraribabu Shrestha, acquitted all accused parties, citing a lack of sufficient evidence to prove the corruption charges. Dissatisfied with this verdict, the CIAA has since filed an appeal at the Supreme Court, moving the case to the next judicial level.</p>
