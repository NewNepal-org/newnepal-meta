  "title": "Encroachment of Rani Mahal Palace Land",
  "description": "<p>The case involves the illegal encroachment and private registration of land belonging to the historic Rani Mahal palace, located in Palpa district on the banks of the Kali Gandaki River. An investigation by the <strong>National Vigilance Centre (NVC)</strong> revealed that a significant portion of the palace's land, estimated to be between <strong>24 to 30 ropani</strong>, was systematically transferred to private individuals through collusion between government officials and other parties.</p><p>The process of encroachment reportedly began during a land survey in 1975-76 (2032 BS). The situation was significantly exacerbated by a fire in the Palpa Durbar on January 31, 2006, which destroyed crucial documents at the District Land Revenue and Survey offices. This loss of records was allegedly exploited to formalize the illegal registrations.</p><p>The NVC's investigation concluded that the illegal registration was facilitated by the collusion of employees from the <strong>District Land Revenue Office (Malpot)</strong>, the <strong>District Survey Office (Napi)</strong>, and the offices of the then-local Village Development Committees (VDCs). While official records at the Survey Office indicate Rani Mahal covers only about 5 ropani, historical and local accounts suggest the original area was much larger.</p><p>Key findings of the investigation include:</p><ul><li>Systematic partitioning and registration of palace land to private individuals.</li><li>Manipulation of official survey maps, where land not subdivided in main maps was shown as partitioned in local office maps.</li><li>Use of a recommendation from the former Khani Gaun VDC to register a 5-ropani plot to an individual in 2006.</li></ul><p>The Department of Archaeology officially handed over the responsibility for the palace to <strong>Tansen Municipality</strong> on August 25, 2018, which has since initiated its own efforts to investigate and reclaim the encroached land.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is noted in preliminary research but could not be independently verified by credible public sources:</p><ul><li><strong>Main Accused - 'Samakote family' (सामाकोटे परिवार):</strong> No public reports or official documents reviewed mention a 'Samakote family' in connection with this case. The individuals identified in the NVC investigation and news reports are Mahalakshmi Shrestha, Chakrapani Pande, and the Thapa brothers.</li><li><strong>Amount of Land Encroached - '40 Ropani':</strong> Some initial claims suggested a loss of 40 ropani. However, the official NVC investigation and subsequent media reports consistently cite the encroached area as being between <strong>24 to 30 ropani</strong>. The 40 ropani figure is not substantiated by the available evidence.</li></ul><p>Additionally, it is reported that individuals Chakrapani Pande, Thambahadur Thapa, and Durgabahadur Thapa, who had land registered in their names, have not come forward to formally establish their title (श्रेस्ता कायम), making their exact role and the current legal status of that specific plot unclear.</p>",
