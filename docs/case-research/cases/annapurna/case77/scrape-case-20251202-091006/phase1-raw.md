#### **Description**

<p>The case involves the illegal encroachment and private registration of land belonging to the historic Rani Mahal palace, located in Palpa district on the banks of the Kali Gandaki River. Investigations, primarily by the National Vigilance Centre (NVC), revealed that a significant portion of the palace's land was systematically transferred to private individuals through collusion between government officials and land mafias.</p>

<p>The encroachment dates back to a 1975-76 (2032 BS) land survey, during which parts of the palace's surrounding area were registered in the names of individuals. The situation was exacerbated by a fire in the Palpa Durbar on January 31, 2006 (2062 Magh 18 BS), which destroyed crucial documents at the District Land Revenue and Survey offices. This loss of records was exploited to formalize the illegal registrations.</p>

<p>According to the NVC's investigation, the collusion involved employees from the <strong>District Land Revenue Office</strong>, the <strong>District Survey Office</strong>, and the offices of the then-local Village Development Committees (VDCs). The official records at the Survey Office show Rani Mahal covering only 5 ropani, 12 aana, and 2 dam of land, while locals and reports suggest the original area was much larger, between 25 to 30 ropani.</p>

<p>The Department of Archaeology officially handed over the responsibility of the palace to the Tansen Municipality, which subsequently began efforts to investigate and reclaim the encroached land.</p>

#### **Allegations and Findings**

<ul>
    <li><strong>Systematic Encroachment:</strong> An investigation by the National Vigilance Centre (NVC) concluded that approximately 30 ropani of Rani Mahal's land was encroached upon. Another report citing the NVC mentioned the figure as 24 ropani.</li>
    <li><strong>Collusion of Officials:</strong> The NVC report explicitly states that the land was illegally registered in private names through the collusion of employees at the Malpot (Land Revenue) office, Napi (Survey) office, and the concerned VDCs.</li>
    <li><strong>Manipulation of Records:</strong> Land that was not subdivided in the Survey Department's main maps was found to be partitioned in the Palpa Survey Office's maps.</li>
    <li><strong>Destruction of Evidence:</strong> A fire at the Palpa Palace on January 31, 2006 (2062 Magh 18 BS) destroyed official documents, which was then used as an opportunity to make the encroached land disappear from government records.</li>
    <li><strong>Illegal Registration:</strong> On June 19, 2006 (2063 Asar 4), a recommendation from the former Khani Gaun VDC office was used to register a 5-ropani plot (Kitta No. 660) in the name of Mahalakshmi Shrestha. Other plots were registered under the names of Chakrapani Pande, Thambahadur Thapa, and Durgabahadur Thapa.</li>
</ul>
