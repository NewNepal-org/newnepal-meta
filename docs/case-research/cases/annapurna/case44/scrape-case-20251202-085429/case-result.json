  "title": "Corruption Case Against Former Nayab Subba Raghunath Ghimire for Disproportionate Assets",
  "description": "<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against Raghunath Ghimire, a retired Non-Gazetted First Class Officer (Nayab Subba), accusing him of amassing wealth illegally during his tenure in public service. The case was filed at the Special Court in Kathmandu on April 2, 2023.</p><p>Ghimire joined the civil service on November 14, 1995, and resigned on February 13, 2019. He served in various government offices, including the Department of Customs and the Department of Revenue Investigation. The CIAA's investigation covered the period from his entry into service until mid-January 2023.</p><p>The investigation revealed a significant discrepancy between his legitimate income and his total expenses and investments. The CIAA calculated his legitimate income from sources like salary, his wife's income, loans, and land sales to be <strong>NPR 52,516,327.44</strong>. However, his expenditures and investments during the same period amounted to <strong>NPR 73,962,984.67</strong>.</p><p>The CIAA alleges that the difference, <strong>NPR 21,446,657.24</strong>, was acquired through corrupt means and constitutes illicit enrichment. The charges were filed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2017 (BS) and the prevailing Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (BS). The CIAA has sought to recover the principal amount, an equivalent fine, and a jail sentence.</p><p>His wife, <strong>Sharada Gautam Ghimire</strong>, has been named as a co-defendant. The CIAA alleges that Ghimire misused his authority to help her become a customs agent and subsequently used her name to conceal illegally acquired assets. The CIAA is seeking the confiscation of properties held in her name, which include:</p><ul><li>Land purchases</li><li>House construction</li><li>Company investments</li><li>Share purchases</li><li>Bank deposits</li></ul>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Raghunath Ghimire was reportedly a central figure in a major political scandal involving the alleged manipulation of tax rates in the federal budget on May 28, 2022. It was alleged that Ghimire met with then-Finance Minister Janardan Sharma late at night to alter tax rates before the budget was presented to Parliament. This led to Minister Sharma's temporary resignation, although a parliamentary investigation panel later acquitted him, citing a lack of evidence as CCTV footage from the period had been deleted. While this scandal provides context, it is separate from the formal disproportionate assets case.</p><p>An editorial piece suggested that the CIAA initially estimated Ghimire might have accumulated wealth worth as much as <strong>NPR 500 million</strong>, a figure significantly higher than the amount specified in the official charges filed in court. This larger amount remains an unverified estimate and is not part of the legal proceedings.</p>",
