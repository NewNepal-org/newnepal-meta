### Case Details

**case_name:** Corruption Case against Raghunath Ghimire (Former Nayab Subba) for Disproportionate Assets
**case_id:** case44
**status:** Under Trial
**summary:** The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against Raghunath Ghimire, a retired Non-Gazetted First Class Officer (Nayab Subba), at the Special Court in Kathmandu on April 2, 2023. Ghimire is accused of illegally amassing wealth amounting to NPR 21,446,657.24 during his tenure in public service. The CIAA's investigation found a significant discrepancy between his legitimate income of NPR 52,516,327.44 and his total expenditures and investments of NPR 73,962,984.67 over the investigation period. His wife, Sharada Gautam Ghimire, has also been named as a defendant for the purpose of confiscating assets held in her name.
**description:**
<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) initiated an investigation into Raghunath Ghimire, a former Nayab Subba who served in various roles, including at the Department of Customs, airport customs offices, and the Department of Revenue Investigation. He joined the civil service on November 14, 1995, and resigned on February 13, 2019.</p>
<p>The investigation covered the period from his entry into service in November 1995 until mid-January 2023 (Poush 2079 BS). During this time, the CIAA calculated his legitimate income from sources such as salary, his wife's income, employee savings funds, loans, and land sales to be <strong>NPR 52,516,327.44</strong>. However, his total expenses and investments were found to be <strong>NPR 73,962,984.67</strong>.</p>
<p>The CIAA alleges that the difference, amounting to <strong>NPR 21,446,657.24</strong>, constitutes wealth amassed through illegal means and corruption. The case was filed at the Special Court on April 2, 2023, seeking to recover the principal amount, an equivalent fine, and a jail sentence of up to two years. The legal action is based on the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2017 (साविक भ्रष्टाचार निवारण ऐन, २०१७) and the prevailing Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (प्रचलित भ्रष्टाचार निवारण ऐन, २०५९).</p>
<p>His wife, <strong>Sharada Gautam Ghimire</strong>, who worked as a customs agent, was also implicated. The CIAA has made her a co-defendant, alleging that Ghimire misused his authority to help her become a customs agent and subsequently used her name to conceal the illegally acquired assets. The properties allegedly hidden in her name include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Land purchases</li>
    <li>House construction</li>
    <li>Company investments</li>
    <li>Share purchases</li>
    <li>Bank deposits</li>
</ul>
<p>The CIAA has sought the confiscation of these assets held in Sharada Gautam Ghimire's name to recover the claimed amount.</p>
**unverified_info:**
<p>Raghunath Ghimire was also a central figure in a major political scandal involving the alleged manipulation of tax rates in the federal budget on May 28, 2022. It was reported that Ghimire, acting as a representative of business groups, met with then-Finance Minister Janardan Sharma in the middle of the night to alter tax rates just before the budget was presented to Parliament. This led to Minister Sharma's resignation, although a parliamentary investigation panel later acquitted him and others for lack of proof, noting that CCTV footage of the meeting had been conspicuously deleted. While this scandal provides context to Ghimire's activities, the disproportionate assets case is a separate legal action.</p>
<p>An editorial piece mentioned that the CIAA estimated Ghimire might have accumulated wealth worth as much as <strong>NPR 500 million</strong>, far exceeding the official charged amount, though this figure is not part of the formal charges filed in court.</p>
