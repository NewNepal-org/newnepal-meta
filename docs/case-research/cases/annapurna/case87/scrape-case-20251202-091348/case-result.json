  "title": "33kg Gold Smuggling and Sanam Shakya Murder Case",
  "description": "<p>The 33kg gold smuggling case, which emerged in March 2018, exposed a large-scale organized crime syndicate that had been trafficking gold through Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for years. The investigation was triggered by the murder of <strong>Sanam Shakya</strong>, a gold carrier for the smuggling ring, on March 2, 2018.</p><p>The mastermind of the operation, <strong>Chudamani Upreti, alias 'Gore'</strong>, orchestrated the torture and murder of Shakya in an attempt to recover a missing 33.5 kg gold consignment that had disappeared after being cleared from TIA on January 23, 2018. The discovery of Shakya's body in a vehicle in Morang initiated a high-level probe by a committee formed by the Home Ministry, led by Joint Secretary Ishwar Raj Paudel.</p><p>The committee's investigation revealed that Gore's syndicate had smuggled an estimated <strong>3,799.5 kilograms of gold</strong>, valued at over Rs 17 billion, into Nepal since 2015. The probe led to the Morang District Attorney's Office filing charges against 63 individuals, including high-ranking police officers, for organized crime, smuggling, abduction, and murder.</p><p>Key findings from the investigation included:</p><ul><li><strong>Scale of Smuggling:</strong> The syndicate smuggled nearly 3,800 kg of gold from Dubai through TIA between 2015 and 2018.</li><li><strong>Modus Operandi:</strong> The operation relied on a network of police officials, customs agents, and airport staff to bypass security. SSP Shyam Khatri was alleged to have charged Rs 50,000 per kg of gold to facilitate its passage.</li><li><strong>Murder and Cover-up:</strong> Sanam Shakya was tortured to death with electric shocks. Allegations surfaced that police officials from the Metropolitan Police Crime Division attempted to help Gore dispose of the body and cover up the crime.</li></ul><p>In a controversial verdict on October 5, 2021, the Morang District Court sentenced 'Gore' and six accomplices to life imprisonment for the abduction and murder of Sanam Shakya. However, all accused parties, including 'Gore', were acquitted of the gold smuggling charges. Critically, all implicated police personnel, including former DIG Govinda Prasad Niraula and SSP Dibesh Lohani, were acquitted of all charges, raising significant questions about accountability. Furthering the controversy, the 752-page detailed investigation report submitted by the Paudel committee subsequently disappeared from the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<ul><li><p>Chudamani Upreti 'Gore' reportedly claimed during interrogation that he was merely a manager for the smuggling racket and that the ultimate owners were Indian businessmen, naming one <strong>M.K. Agrawal</strong> as the owner of the missing 33.5kg consignment.</p></li><li><p>It was alleged that Gore revealed the names of 10 additional 'Hundi' operators and businessmen involved in the network who were not among the original 63 individuals charged by the District Attorney's Office.</p></li><li><p>A highly dubious report from a future date suggested that 'Gore' might have escaped from Sundhara Prison in September 2025 during widespread unrest. This information is unconfirmed and likely erroneous.</p></li></ul>",
