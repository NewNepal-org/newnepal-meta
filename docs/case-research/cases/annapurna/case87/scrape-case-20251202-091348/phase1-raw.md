## 33kg Gold Smuggling and Sanam Shakya Murder Case: A Comprehensive Overview

**Case Summary:** The 33kg gold smuggling case, which surfaced in 2018, exposed a massive, organized criminal network responsible for trafficking enormous quantities of gold into Nepal, primarily through the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). The investigation into the smuggling ring was triggered by the brutal murder of Sanam Shakya, a carrier for the smugglers, leading to the implication of dozens of individuals, including high-ranking police officers, businessmen, and customs officials. The case is marked by the central role of mastermind Chudamani Upreti, alias 'Gore', the shocking murder used to retrieve a lost gold consignment, and the subsequent controversial legal proceedings that saw most of the accused, particularly senior police officials, acquitted.

<p>The scandal began when a 33.5 kg consignment of smuggled gold, which arrived from the United Arab Emirates on January 23, 2018, vanished after being cleared from the TIA. In an attempt to locate the missing gold, the smuggling ring's leader, Chudamani Upreti 'Gore', orchestrated the abduction and torture of several of his own operatives. This culminated in the death of Sanam Shakya, who was electrocuted and beaten to death on March 2, 2018, in Urlabari, Morang. The discovery of Shakya's body in a vehicle by police on March 3, 2018, blew the lid off the entire operation.</p>

<p>A high-level investigation committee, formed by the Home Ministry and led by Joint Secretary Ishwar Raj Paudel, was established to probe the murder and the underlying smuggling network. The committee's findings were staggering, concluding that Gore's syndicate had smuggled approximately 3,799.5 kilograms (nearly 38 quintals) of gold, worth over Rs 17 billion, into Nepal since 2015. The probe implicated a wide array of individuals, leading to the Morang District Attorney's Office filing charges against 63 people for organized crime, smuggling, abduction, and murder. The number of accused eventually grew, with reports mentioning charges against 75 to 77 individuals.</p>

<p>Despite the extensive investigation, the case took a controversial turn in the courts. While Chudamani Upreti 'Gore' and several of his core operatives were convicted for the murder of Sanam Shakya and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Morang District Court in October 2021, they were not convicted on the smuggling charges. Crucially, all the police officials implicated in the case, including former DIG Govinda Prasad Niraula, SSP Dibesh Lohani, SP Bikash Raj Khanal, and DSP Prajit KC, were acquitted by the court, a decision that had been foreshadowed by their earlier release on bail by the Biratnagar High Court in 2018. This outcome drew significant public scrutiny and raised questions about the integrity of the legal process. Adding to the mystery, the 752-page detailed report submitted by the Paudel-led committee to the government reportedly vanished from the Prime Minister's Office, hindering subsequent investigations into other gold smuggling cases.</p>

### **Allegations and Findings**

<ul>
    <li><strong>Scale of Smuggling:</strong> The Paudel committee's investigation concluded that the syndicate had smuggled a staggering 3,799.5 kg of gold over approximately five years. This was based on diaries and documents recovered from Chudamani Upreti's residence.</li>
    <li><strong>Modus Operandi:</strong> The gang operated with extensive support from a network of police officials, customs agents, and airport ground staff to clear the smuggled gold from the TIA without inspection. SSP Shyam Khatri allegedly charged Rs 50,000 per kg to facilitate the process.</li>
    <li><strong>Murder and Cover-up:</strong> The murder of Sanam Shakya was a direct result of the disappearance of a 33.5 kg gold consignment. Gore and his men tortured Shakya to death with electric shocks to extract information. There were further allegations that police officials, particularly from the Metropolitan Police Crime Division, attempted to help Gore dispose of the body and escape.</li>
    <li><strong>Disappeared Investigation Report:</strong> The comprehensive 752-page report by the Paudel committee, which reportedly named 293 individuals involved in the smuggling ecosystem and recommended further action, was handed to the Prime Minister's Office in 2018 but has since been "lost" or "disappeared," preventing its use in subsequent investigations.</li>
</ul>

### **Unverified Information**

<ul>
    <li><p>Chudamani Upreti 'Gore' reportedly claimed he was only a manager or an agent in the smuggling racket, not the ultimate owner, and that the gold belonged to Indian businessmen who had threatened him. One name mentioned as the owner of the specific 33.5kg consignment was M.K. Agrawal.</p></li>
    <li><p>During his initial interrogation, Gore allegedly revealed the names of 10 additional 'Hundi' operators and businessmen who were involved but not among the original 63 charged individuals.</p></li>
    <li><p>There are reports from September 2025 alleging that Chudamani Upreti 'Gore' escaped from Sundhara Prison during a period of widespread unrest. These reports claim he was among many inmates who broke out when one jail was breached by inmates from another. This information is from a future date relative to the current time and should be treated with extreme caution.</p></li>
