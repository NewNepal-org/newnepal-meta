  "title": "Sardu Jaladhar Watershed Land Encroachment Case",
  "description": "<p>This case concerns the illegal registration and sale of over 300 bighas of government-owned watershed land in the Sardu Jaladhar area of Dharan, Sunsari. This land is the primary drinking water source for the Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City.</p><p>The issue originated between 1977 and 1981 (2034-2038 BS) when the Government of Nepal compensated and relocated approximately 180 families from 348 bighas of land to protect the watershed, following a directive from King Birendra. The compensated families were given alternative land in the Bayarban area of Morang District. However, a critical administrative failure occurred: the land records for the Sardu plots were never updated to reflect government ownership (a process known as <strong>'lagat katta'</strong>). The land remained registered in the names of the original, compensated owners.</p><p>Decades later, a group allegedly led by political figures and local strongmen, including <strong>Nain Kumar Rai</strong>, <strong>Bansi Moktan</strong>, and <strong>Jagat Rai</strong>, discovered this loophole. They allegedly colluded with some original landowners to fraudulently acquire and sell off the valuable watershed land.</p><p>The illegal activities were exacerbated by a <strong>Supreme Court</strong> decision in July 2012. The court dismissed a review petition filed by the Sunsari District Development Committee, reportedly because evidence of the prior compensation was not adequately presented. This ruling emboldened the land grabbers, leading to widespread plotting and selling of the public land.</p><p>Following a comprehensive investigation by the 'Commission for the Investigation of Government, Public and Guthi Land, 2076 BS,' the government initiated action to reclaim the land. The commission's report confirmed that 348 bighas were illegally held and recommended prosecution of those involved. Acting on this, the Land Revenue Office in Dharan has successfully cancelled private registrations and returned a significant portion of the land to state ownership:</p><ul><li><strong>May 11, 2021:</strong> 182 bigha, 10 kattha, 4 dhur</li><li><strong>December 22, 2022:</strong> 23 bigha, 2 kattha, 0.5 dhur</li><li><strong>February 10, 2023:</strong> 1 bigha, 16 kattha, 1 dhur</li></ul><p>As of early 2023, over 312 bighas have been recovered. However, approximately 42 bighas that were sold to numerous third parties remain in dispute, complicated by a stay order from the High Court in Biratnagar.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are several serious allegations that require further verification:</p><ul><li>An article by Annapurna Post alleges that a corruption file on the Sardu case was deliberately made to 'disappear' from the CIAA's Itahari office. This was allegedly done by the then-chief, <strong>Prem Prasad Bhattarai</strong>, to protect his brother, <strong>Phadindra Bhattarai</strong>, a Land Revenue Officer implicated in a separate fraudulent land transfer in the same area.</li><li>The same article alleges that Supreme Court judges were in collusion with the 'land mafias' to secure a favorable verdict, which enabled the land grabbing.</li><li>The full extent of collusion by officials within the Land Revenue Office and Survey Office is not fully established, though several employees, including Kharidars Ram Bhattarai and Om Lamsal, and Survey Chief Shashikant Jha, have been named in news reports as being complicit.</li></ul>",
