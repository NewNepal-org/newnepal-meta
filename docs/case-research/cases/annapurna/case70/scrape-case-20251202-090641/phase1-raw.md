Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the Sardu Jaladhar land case.

### **Case Summary**

The case involves the illegal registration and sale of over 300 bighas of government-owned land in the Sardu watershed area of Dharan, Sunsari District. This area is the primary source of drinking water for the Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City. The core of the issue lies with land that was supposed to be transferred to government ownership in the late 1970s after the original landowners were compensated with different plots of land in Morang. However, the land registration was never officially updated, allowing "land mafias" decades later to fraudulently acquire and sell the valuable watershed land.

### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

*   **Initial Government Action:** In 2033 BS (c. 1976 AD), King Birendra, responding to requests from Dharan locals to protect their water source, ordered the relocation of residents from the watershed area.
*   **Land Swap (Satta Bharna):** Between 2034 and 2038 BS (c. 1977-1981 AD), approximately 180 families living on 348 bighas of land in the Sardu watershed were compensated with land in the Bayarban area of Morang District.
*   **Critical Failure:** Despite the land swap, the original land records in the Sardu area were not cancelled (*lagat katta*), leaving the land registered in the names of the compensated individuals.
*   **Fraudulent Acquisition:** Decades later, a group allegedly led by Nain Kumar Rai, Bansi Moktan, and Jagat Rai, discovered this administrative loophole. They collaborated with some of the original landowners, like Birke Rai, to take control of the land and begin selling it off.
*   **Supreme Court Decisions:** After the District Development Committee of Sunsari halted transactions in 2058 BS (c. 2001 AD), the land grabbers took the case to the Supreme Court. They won because evidence of the prior land swap compensation was not presented to the court. A subsequent review petition filed by the DDC in 2068 BS (c. 2011 AD) was dismissed by the Supreme Court in July 2012 (Shrawan 8, 2069 BS), which intensified the illegal plotting and selling of the land.
*   **Government Investigation:** A high-level commission, the "Commission for the Investigation of Government, Public and Guthi Land, 2076 BS," investigated the matter. It concluded that 348 bighas were still improperly held in private names and recommended the land be returned to the government and that those involved in fraud and corruption be prosecuted.
*   **Land Recovery:** Acting on the commission's report, the Ministry of Land Management directed the Dharan Land Revenue Office to cancel the private registrations.
    *   On May 11, 2021 (Baisakh 28, 2078 BS), 182 bigha, 10 kattha, and 4 dhur were returned to state ownership.
    *   On December 22, 2022 (Poush 7, 2079 BS), an additional 23 bigha, 2 kattha, and 0.5 dhur were recovered.
    *   On February 10, 2023 (Magh 27, 2079 BS), 1 bigha, 16 kattha, and 1 dhur were returned after accused kingpin Jagat Prasad Rai consented, reportedly following pressure from a CIAA investigation.
    *   In total, over 312 bighas have been re-registered in the name of the watershed.
*   **Remaining Disputed Land:** Approximately 42 bighas that had been sold and transferred to numerous new owners remains in dispute. The process to reclaim this land is complicated by a stay order from the High Court in Biratnagar.
*   **Allegations against Officials:** An Annapurna Post article alleges that a corruption file on the case was made to "disappear" from the CIAA's Itahari office by its then-chief, Prem Prasad Bhattarai, to protect his brother, Phadindra Bhattarai, a Land Revenue Officer implicated in a related illegal land transfer in the same area. The article also names other Land Revenue and Survey office employees as complicit in fraudulently registering 19 katthas of government land to a private individual.
