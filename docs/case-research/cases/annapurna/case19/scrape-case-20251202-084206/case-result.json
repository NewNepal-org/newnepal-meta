  "title": "Irregularities, Delays, and Corruption in the Procurement and Distribution of Smart Driving Licenses",
  "description": "<p>The Government of Nepal, through the <strong>Department of Transport Management (DoTM)</strong>, initiated a project to replace paper-based driving licenses with electronic smart cards. The project was part of an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) initiative funded by the <strong>Asian Development Bank (ADB)</strong>. An agreement was signed with <strong>Madras Security Printers Pvt. Ltd. (MSP)</strong> of India in October 2013 to develop the system and supply cards and hardware, with distribution beginning in December 2015.</p><p>From its inception, the project has been marred by severe issues, including <strong>chronic delays, persistent technical failures, supply chain disruptions, and allegations of widespread corruption</strong>. The system's failures have resulted in massive backlogs, at times exceeding 800,000 applicants, forcing citizens to wait for months or even over a year to receive their licenses after passing all required tests.</p><p>The problems have been attributed to multiple factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Faulty Technology:</strong> The software developed by MSP was reportedly buggy and incomplete, and the provided printers were slow and prone to breakdowns.</li><li><strong>Contractual Disputes:</strong> Frequent disputes between the DoTM and its contractors paralyzed operations. In one instance, MSP allegedly attempted to extort an additional $40,000 from the DoTM, relenting only after the department threatened blacklisting.</li><li><strong>Substandard Supplies:</strong> Another contractor, Malika Incorporated, was found to have printed substandard cards that faded over time, forcing a halt to their use.</li></ul><p>A major corruption scandal emerged when an internal DoTM probe revealed that between 2015 and 2023, over <strong>102,000 smart licenses were issued illegally</strong> to individuals who had not passed the mandatory exams. This was allegedly achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Electronic Driving License and Vehicle Registration System (EDLVRS). Consequently, the <strong>Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)</strong> and the <strong>Central Investigation Bureau (CIB)</strong> of the Nepal Police have launched major investigations, targeting numerous current and former DoTM employees.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Several pieces of information related to this case are unconfirmed or lack precise details:</p><ul><li>A September 2022 report claimed the DoTM had paid <strong>90% of a Rs 700 billion contract amount</strong> to Madras Security Printers. This figure is exceptionally high and is widely believed to be a reporting error, possibly meaning Rs 700 million. The exact total value of all contracts with MSP over the years remains unclear.</li><li>In early 2021, the DoTM reportedly entered into an agreement with an unnamed <strong>French company</strong> to procure 1.4 million cards. This deal allegedly ran into 'personalization' problems as the new cards were not compatible with the existing software provided by MSP. It is unconfirmed which company secured this contract.</li><li>A German company, <strong>Muhlbauer ID Services GmbH</strong>, reportedly secured a contract worth Rs 190 million to provide 120,000 smart cards. This led to complications when MSP, the original contractor, initially refused to personalize cards from a different manufacturer.</li><li>The <strong>55th Annual Report of the Auditor General</strong> noted an irregularity regarding the license's validity period. The smart cards were procured with a 10-year warranty, but the driving license itself is only valid for 5 years as per Nepali law, indicating a mismatch in procurement specifications and a potential waste of funds.</li></ul>",
