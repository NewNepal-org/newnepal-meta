### Description of the Case

<p>The Government of Nepal, through the Department of Transport Management (DoTM), initiated a project to replace traditional paper-based driving licenses with electronic chip-embedded smart cards. The project was launched as part of an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development project funded by a grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). An initial agreement was signed with <strong>Madras Security Printers (MSP)</strong> of India in October 2013 to develop the software and supply the cards and hardware. The distribution of the first smart licenses began in December 2015 (Poush 2072 BS).</p>
<p>From its inception, the project has been plagued by a myriad of issues, including <strong>chronic delays, technical failures, supply chain problems, and allegations of widespread corruption</strong>. Service seekers have been forced to wait for months, and sometimes over a year, to receive their licenses after passing all required tests, creating a significant backlog that has at times exceeded 800,000 applicants. The entire system has been described as slow, cumbersome, and anything but 'smart'.</p>
<p>The problems stem from multiple sources: the software developed by MSP was reportedly buggy and incomplete; printers were either too slow or broke down; and there were constant shortages of blank cards. Disputes between the DoTM and its contractors, as well as infighting between different companies supplying cards, printers, and software, have led to operational paralysis. In one instance, a contractor, Malika Incorporated, was found to have printed substandard cards that faded over time. In another, MSP was accused of "blackmailing" the DoTM by demanding an additional $40,000 to personalize cards, only relenting after the Department threatened to blacklist the company.</p>
<p>Investigations have uncovered significant corruption within the DoTM. An internal probe revealed that between 2015 and 2023, over 102,000 smart licenses were issued illegally to individuals who had not passed the mandatory written and trial exams. This was allegedly done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Electronic Driving License and Vehicle Registration System (EDLVRS). As a result, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of the Nepal Police have launched major investigations, targeting numerous DoTM employees.</p>

### Allegations and Unverified Information

<div class="unverified_info">
    <ul>
        <li>A report from September 2022 claimed the DoTM had already paid <strong>90% of a Rs 700 billion contract amount</strong> to Madras Security Printers. This figure is exceptionally high and is likely a significant reporting error, possibly meaning Rs 700 million. The exact total contract values over the years remain unclear.</li>
        <li>In early 2021, the DoTM reportedly reached an agreement with an unnamed <strong>French company</strong> to purchase 1.4 million cards. This deal ran into "personalization" problems because the new cards were not compatible with the existing software. In 2017, three French companies (Oberthur Technologies, PW Technologies, and Cilpsals Technology) had bid for a tender, but it is unconfirmed which, if any, secured this later contract.</li>
        <li>A German company, <strong>Muhlbauer ID Services GmbH</strong>, secured a contract worth Rs 190 million to provide 120,000 smart cards, but this led to complications with MSP, who initially refused to personalize the cards from a different manufacturer.</li>
        <li>The Auditor General's 55th Annual Report noted an irregularity in the license's validity period. The smart cards were procured with a 10-year warranty, but the driving license itself is only valid for 5 years as per the law, suggesting a mismatch in procurement specifications.</li>
    </ul>
