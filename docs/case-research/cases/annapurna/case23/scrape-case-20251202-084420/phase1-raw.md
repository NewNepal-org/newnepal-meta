Here is the comprehensive report on the case concerning government funding for a private snake farm linked to Jhalanath Khanal.

### **Case Summary**

The case involves the misuse of government funds allocated for establishing a snake venom collection, processing, and production center in Sarlahi, Nepal. The project was to be implemented by the Jhalanath Khanal Institute of Health Sciences, a private foundation. In October 2023, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against seven individuals, alleging that they colluded to illegally disburse and misappropriate state funds intended for the anti-venom project. In June 2024, the Special Court convicted five of the accused, including a former provincial minister and officials of the foundation.

### **Detailed Information**

#### **Description**
<p>The case revolves around significant financial irregularities concerning a project to establish a 'snake farm' and anti-venom production facility in Lalbandi Municipality, Sarlahi. The project was spearheaded by the <strong>Jhalanath Khanal Institute of Health Sciences</strong> (also known as Jhalanath Khanal Foundation and later, National Health Sciences Foundation), a private entity named after former Prime Minister Jhalanath Khanal.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year 2019/20 (2076/77 BS), the Madhesh Province government allocated funds from a supplementary grant provided by the federal government for the project. The total planned project was reported to be worth <strong>NPR 720 million (72 crore)</strong>, to be funded jointly by the federal government, Madhesh Province, and Lalbandi Municipality.</p>
<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched an investigation and discovered that government officials had unlawfully partnered with the private foundation to disburse a significant portion of these funds. The CIAA alleges that approximately <strong>NPR 179.8 million (17.98 crore)</strong> was embezzled. Instead of being used for the project's primary objective of producing anti-venom to treat snakebites, a prevalent issue in the region, the funds were allegedly spent on luxury items, including vehicles, electronics, and furniture.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2023, the CIAA filed a formal corruption case at the Special Court against seven individuals. On June 25, 2024, the court delivered its verdict, convicting five individuals for corruption while acquitting two.</p>

#### **Main Allegations**
<ul>
    <li>Illegal disbursement of government funds to a private foundation with zero cost-sharing obligation, contrary to legal provisions.</li>
    <li>Collusion between government officials and foundation members to misuse state funds.</li>
    <li>Submission of falsified documents to the National Planning Commission to fraudulently obtain a supplementary grant from the federal government.</li>
    <li>Embezzlement of state funds by spending them on non-approved, luxurious items rather than the intended project activities.</li>
    <li>Causing a loss of at least <strong>NPR 179.8 million</strong> to the state treasury.</li>
</ul>

### **Evidence and Sources**

#### **Unverified Information:**
<p>While the initial report mentioned a loss of "72 करोड", the formal corruption case filed by the CIAA focuses on the misappropriation of approximately <strong>NPR 18 crore (179.8 million)</strong> which was the amount disbursed in the first phase. The 72 crore figure likely represents the total planned budget for the multi-year project, which did not fully materialize due to the corruption.</p>
