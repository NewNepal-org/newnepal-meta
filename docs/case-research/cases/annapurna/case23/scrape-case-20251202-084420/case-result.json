  "description": "<p>The case revolves around significant financial irregularities concerning a project to establish a snake venom collection, processing, and production center in Lalbandi Municipality, Sarlahi. The project was spearheaded by the <strong>Jhalanath Khanal Institute of Health Sciences</strong>, a private foundation named after former Prime Minister Jhalanath Khanal.</p><p>In the fiscal year 2019/20, the Madhesh Province government, using a supplementary grant from the federal government, allocated funds for the project. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) discovered that government officials had unlawfully partnered with the private foundation. It was alleged that approximately <strong>NPR 179.8 million</strong> was embezzled, with funds being spent on luxury items such as vehicles and furniture instead of the project's primary objectives.</p><p>On October 8, 2023, the CIAA filed a corruption case at the Special Court against seven individuals, including a former provincial minister and officials of the foundation. On June 25, 2024, the Special Court delivered its verdict, convicting five of the accused for corruption and acquitting two others.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The total planned budget for the multi-year project was widely reported to be <strong>NPR 720 million (72 crore)</strong>. However, the formal corruption case filed by the CIAA and the subsequent conviction focused on the misappropriation of approximately <strong>NPR 179.8 million (17.98 crore)</strong>, which was the amount disbursed in the first phase. The full NPR 720 million project did not materialize due to the exposure of the corruption.</p>",
