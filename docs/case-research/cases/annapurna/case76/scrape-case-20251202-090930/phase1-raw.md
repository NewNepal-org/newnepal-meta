### **External Research and Verification**

*   **Status:** No additional information found.
*   **Details:** Searches were conducted using the names of the accused, the company, and keywords related to the case in both English and Nepali. These searches did not return any information about this specific land misappropriation case from 2022. The results were dominated by other high-profile land corruption cases in Nepal, such as the Lalita Niwas scam, which are unrelated to the individuals named in this case file. One news article from May 2024 mentions that the National Housing Company (राष्ट्रिय आवास कम्पनी), which appears related to the former Rehabilitation Company, owns thousands of bigha of land across several districts, including Kanchanpur (where a "Punrvas" or Rehabilitation municipality is located) and Nawalparasi, and has faced issues with land encroachment and legal battles. However, the article does not mention this specific case or the individuals involved.
