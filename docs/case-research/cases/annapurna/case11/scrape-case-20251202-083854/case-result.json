  "title": "Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF): Misappropriation of Funds and Unaccounted NPR 19 Billion",
  "description": "<p>The Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF), established in 2003 to support anti-poverty programs, has been embroiled in multiple corruption scandals and large-scale administrative failure. The case involves two primary issues:</p><ol><li><strong>Unaccounted Revolving Fund of NPR 19.37 Billion:</strong> Following the government's decision in 2018 and formal announcement in 2021 to dissolve the PAF, a massive revolving fund of approximately <strong>NPR 19.37 billion</strong> was left in an administrative vacuum. This fund, comprising government contributions (largely from World Bank grants) and community-generated capital, was distributed among 32,276 community groups. The government dissolved the parent body without establishing a clear mechanism for transferring, monitoring, or recovering the funds. As of late 2024, the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, which inherited PAF's portfolio, formally acknowledged that it has no information on the status or whereabouts of this money, raising fears of widespread misuse or loss.</li><li><strong>Documented Corruption by Officials:</strong> The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has filed multiple cases against PAF officials for direct embezzlement and fraud. These cases involve:<ul><li>Creating fake bills and forging documents for programs that were never conducted.</li><li>A <strong>March 2015</strong> case filed against 14 top officials, including then-Executive Director Rajbabu Shrestha, for embezzling <strong>NPR 27.86 million</strong>.</li><li>An <strong>April 2016</strong> case against 36 officials for misappropriating <strong>NPR 43.4 million</strong>, which resulted in the conviction of 17 officials by the Special Court in August 2022.</li><li>A <strong>2019</strong> probe by the National Vigilance Centre (NVC) which uncovered irregularities worth <strong>NPR 185.96 million</strong> and revealed that office equipment valued at <strong>NPR 41.47 million</strong> was missing.</li></ul></ol><p>These events highlight a combination of systemic corruption within the institution and a major governance failure in managing its dissolution, leaving billions in public and community funds unaccounted for.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While the total amount of the revolving fund is known to be NPR 19.37 billion, the following details remain unverified:</p><ul><li>The exact amount of the fund that has been misused versus what might still be circulating correctly within community organizations or newly formed cooperatives is unknown. The entire fund is currently classified as unaccounted for by the government.</li><li>The specific role and accountability of the various Councils of Ministers involved, beyond the policy decision to dissolve the fund without a clear transition and monitoring plan, has not been formally investigated or specified in public records. The issue is primarily framed as one of administrative and policy failure.</li></ul>",
