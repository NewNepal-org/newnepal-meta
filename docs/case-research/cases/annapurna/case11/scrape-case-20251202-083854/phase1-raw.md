### **Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) - Raw Findings**

**Case Subject:** Poverty Alleviation Fund (गरिवी निवारण कोष)
**Primary Allegation:** Misappropriation and mismanagement of government and community funds, particularly a revolving fund of approximately NPR 19 billion, following the dissolution of the Fund.
**Year of Focus:** The issue of the NPR 19 billion fund gained prominence after the government's decision to dissolve the PAF, with official announcements in the 2078/79 (2021 AD) budget and subsequent administrative actions. The initial user query cites the year 2079 BS (2022/23 AD), a period during which the fund's status remained unresolved.

### **1. The Unaccounted NPR 19 Billion Fund**

This is the central issue corresponding to the "19 arba" (19 billion) loss cited in the initial request. It pertains not to a single act of theft, but to the potential loss and lack of accountability for a massive fund following a government decision to dissolve the Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF).

#### **Description**

<p>The Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF), established in 2003, managed extensive anti-poverty programs, primarily through revolving funds provided to community-based organizations. Over its lifetime, it channeled approximately <strong>NPR 19.37 billion</strong> into these programs. This amount consisted of about NPR 15 billion from the government (largely funded by World Bank grants) and an additional NPR 4 billion generated by the communities themselves. The funds were distributed among approximately 32,276 community groups across 64 districts.</p>

<p>In November 2018, the Government of Nepal decided to scrap the PAF, reasoning that its functions would be better handled by newly elected local governments. However, the formal dissolution was delayed. In the budget speech for the fiscal year 2078/79 (2021 AD), then-Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel officially announced the dissolution of the PAF. The plan was to convert the community organizations managing the money into cooperatives and use the NPR 19 billion as seed capital.</p>

<p>Following this decision, the entire NPR 19 billion fund was left in a state of limbo. The government dissolved the parent body without putting a clear mechanism in place to manage, monitor, or recover the vast sums distributed at the community level. As a result, the funds are now considered "missing" or "unaccounted for."</p>

<p>In late 2024 (Mangsir 2081 BS), the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, which inherited the PAF's portfolio, formally acknowledged that it did not know the status of the money. The ministry began a process of trying to trace the funds by requesting information from the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration to inquire with local governments about the status of the community organizations and the revolving funds. This has raised serious concerns about the large-scale misuse or loss of funds intended for poverty alleviation.</p>

#### **Timeline of Events (NPR 19 Billion Fund)**

*   **November 2018:** The Cabinet decides to scrap the Poverty Alleviation Fund, as World Bank aid had also ceased.
*   **2018-2021:** The decision to dissolve the fund is stalled, leaving it operational but without new programs.
*   **May 29, 2021 (15 Jestha 2078):** Then-Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, in the national budget, announces the formal dissolution of the PAF and the plan to convert its community groups into cooperatives with the NPR 19 billion as seed money.
*   **September 10, 2021 (25 Bhadra 2078):** A new government led by a new finance minister, Janardan Sharma, presents a replacement budget, leaving the execution of the PAF dissolution plan uncertain.
*   **November 29, 2021 (13 Mangsir 2078):** The Council of Ministers decides to bring the PAF's structure under the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, effectively downgrading it to a ministry division.
*   **November 27, 2024 (12 Mangsir 2081):** The Ministry of Land Management sends a letter to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration seeking details on the status of the PAF's community groups and the NPR 19.37 billion fund, admitting the federal government has no information on its whereabouts.

#### **Associated Individuals/Entities**
*   **The then Council of Ministers (Multiple Governments):** The issue involves decisions made by successive cabinets.
    *   The cabinet in **November 2018** initiated the dissolution process.
    *   The cabinet in **2021** (led by Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel) formalized the dissolution via the budget.
    *   Subsequent governments were responsible for the failure to implement a proper handover and monitoring mechanism.
*   **Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation:** The entity that inherited the PAF's responsibilities and is now tasked with tracing the missing funds.

#### **Unverified Information**
<ul>
  <li>The exact amount of the NPR 19 billion that has been misused, versus what might still be circulating correctly within cooperatives, is unknown. The entire fund is currently classified as unaccounted for by the government.</li>
  <li>The degree of involvement, if any, of the "तत्कालीन मन्त्रिपरिषद्" (the then Council of Ministers) beyond the policy decision to dissolve the fund without a transition plan is not specified in public sources. The issue appears to be one of administrative and policy failure rather than direct embezzlement by ministers of this specific fund.</li>
</ul>

### **2. Documented Corruption Cases within the Poverty Alleviation Fund**

Separate from the unaccounted NPR 19 billion, the PAF has a documented history of corruption investigated by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and other bodies. These cases involve direct embezzlement, forgery, and misuse of funds by the fund's officials.

#### **Description**

<p>Over the years, the CIAA has filed multiple corruption cases against PAF officials. These cases generally involved staff and management creating fake bills, forging documents for programs that were never conducted, and embezzling funds meant for daily allowances and project implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Key cases include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>March 2015 Case:</strong> The CIAA charged 14 top officials, including Executive Director Rajbabu Shrestha, with embezzling <strong>NPR 27.86 million</strong> during the fiscal years 2010-2012 by submitting fake bills and claiming expenses for non-existent programs.</li>
    <li><strong>April 2016 Case:</strong> The CIAA filed another case against 36 officials for misappropriating <strong>NPR 43.4 million</strong> between 2009 and 2012 by forging bills. In August 2022, the Special Court convicted 17 of the 36 accused, handing out jail terms and fines. However, 19 others, including former Executive Director Raju Babu Shrestha, were acquitted in this specific case.</li>
    <li><strong>2019 National Vigilance Centre (NVC) Probe:</strong> An investigation by the NVC, a body under the Prime Minister's Office, uncovered irregularities worth <strong>NPR 185.96 million</strong> in PAF's infrastructure and income-generation programs.
