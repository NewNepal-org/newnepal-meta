  "description": "<p>This case concerns the long-term, systematic encroachment and effective disappearance of numerous public ponds in Birgunj, Parsa. The initial allegation stems from an internal document pointing to a specific event in the year <strong>2043 BS (1986/1987 AD)</strong> involving five ponds, resulting in an estimated financial loss in the billions of Nepali Rupees. While a singular event in 1986 remains uncorroborated by public records, there is extensive evidence of widespread and gradual encroachment on public water bodies in Birgunj over several decades.</p><p>A prominent and well-documented example is the case of <strong>Mairam Pokhari</strong>. According to a survey from 2022 BS (c. 1965 AD), the pond originally spanned <strong>4 bighas and 18 kaththa</strong>. Over the years, it was illegally encroached upon and reduced to approximately 15-19 kaththa. A 'Children's Park', partially funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), was later constructed on the encroached land. Locals have accused former mayor <strong>Vijay Saraf</strong> of colluding with business interests to legitimize this encroachment through the park's construction.</p><p>The scale of historical encroachment was highlighted by a recent anti-encroachment campaign initiated by the administration of Mayor <strong>Rajeshman Singh</strong> (elected in 2022). As of April 2024, this campaign has successfully reclaimed <strong>28 public ponds and over 148 bighas of public land</strong>. As part of this drive, illegal structures built on the former Mairam Pokhari land, including parts of <strong>Advance Hospital</strong> and <strong>Shanti Polyclinic</strong>, were demolished.</p><p>Historical ponds in Birgunj that have been subject to encroachment or disappearance include:</p><ul><li>Mairam Pokhari</li><li>Ghadiarwa Pokhari</li><li>Nagwa Pokhari</li><li>Chhapkaiya Pokhari</li><li>Sripur Pokhari</li><li>Ranighat Pokhari</li></ul>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Several key aspects of this case require further investigation as they are currently based on preliminary information or lack direct documentary evidence.</p><ul><li><strong>The 2043 BS (1986/1987 AD) Event:</strong> No public records have been found to confirm a specific, singular event in 2043 BS that caused the disappearance of five ponds. The year's significance is a lead, but the encroachment appears to have been a gradual process over many years.</li><li><strong>Identity of the 'Five Ponds':</strong> It is unclear whether 'Five Ponds' refers to a specific location named 'Panch Pokhari' or five individual, named ponds that were encroached upon around the same time.</li><li><strong>Role of Bimal Prasad Shrivastav:</strong> Bimal Prasad Shrivastav served as the head (Pradhan Panch) of the Birgunj Nagar Panchayat from <strong>1983 to 1989</strong>, coinciding with the alleged 2043 BS incident. While his position places him as the chief executive at the time, no specific evidence has surfaced directly linking him to decisions or actions causing the ponds' disappearance. His potential role, whether through negligence or complicity, remains a primary area for investigation.</li><li><strong>Financial Loss Estimation:</strong> The initial allegation of a loss amounting to 'billions' (अर्वौ) of rupees is an estimate from an internal document. A formal valuation based on the exact area and historical value of the encroached land is required to verify this figure.</li></ul>",
