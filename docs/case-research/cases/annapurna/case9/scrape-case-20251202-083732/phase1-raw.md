## Raw Findings on the Disappearance of Five Ponds in Birgunj

**Case Reference:** Case 9
**Subject:** Disappearance of Five Ponds
**Location:** Birgunj, Parsa District
**Period of Interest:** Circa 2043 BS (1986/1987 AD)

### 1. Initial Allegations from Internal Document

An internal document, `details.md`, outlines a case concerning the "disappearance" of five ponds in the year 2043 BS, resulting in a financial loss estimated to be in the billions ("अर्वौ"). The fields for the main accused and other involved individuals were left blank.

### 2. Identification of Key Figure in Power during 1986

During the period of the alleged incident, Birgunj was governed by a Nagar Panchayat system.

*   **Bimal Prasad Shrivastav** served as the head of the Birgunj municipality from **1983 to 1989**. His tenure as the city's leader directly coincides with the year 2043 BS (1986/1987 AD) mentioned in the case file. This places him as the chief executive of the local governing body at the time the ponds reportedly "disappeared."

### 3. Context of Widespread Pond Encroachment in Birgunj

While specific details from 2043 BS remain elusive, extensive reporting confirms a long and ongoing history of public pond and land encroachment in Birgunj, lending credibility to the core allegation.

*   **Mairam Pokhari Case:** One of the most prominent examples is the encroachment of Mairam Pokhari.
    *   According to a 2022 BS (c. 1965 AD) survey, the pond covered an area of **4 bighas and 18 kaththa**.
    *   Over time, it was systematically encroached upon, shrinking it to a mere 15 to 19 kaththa. A "Children's Park," partially funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), was later built on the remaining land.
    *   Locals have accused former mayor **Vijay Saraf** of colluding with business interests to legitimize this encroachment by building the park.
*   **Recent Reclamation Efforts:** The administration of Mayor **Rajeshman Singh**, elected in 2022, has initiated a significant anti-encroachment campaign.
    *   As of April 2024, the metropolitan authority reported it had successfully reclaimed **28 public ponds and over 148 bighas of public land**. This highlights the massive scale of historical encroachment.
    *   During this campaign, illegal structures built on the former Mairam Pokhari land, including parts of **Advance Hospital** and **Shanti Polyclinic**, were demolished.

### 4. Historical Lists of Ponds in Birgunj

News articles related to the Chhath festival and beautification efforts provide names of several historical and prominent ponds in Birgunj, which could include the five mentioned in the case. These include:

*   Ghadiarwa Pokhari
*   Nagwa Pokhari
*   Chhapkaiya Pokhari
*   Sripur Pokhari
*   Ranighat Pokhari
*   Maidhiya Pokhari
*   Solakpur Chorni Pokhari
*   Paraswa Pokhari
*   Mairam Pokhari (also known as Children's Park area)

### Unverified Information & Further Investigation Areas

*   **Direct Link to 2043 BS:** No public documents or news reports found to date specifically corroborate a singular event in 2043 BS that led to the "disappearance" of five distinct ponds. The process appears to have been gradual over many years. The significance of the year 2043 BS needs to be investigated further. Was it the year a specific policy decision was made? Or when a crucial land survey was altered?
*   **Identity of the "Five Ponds":** It is unclear if "Five Ponds" refers to a specific area named "Panch Pokhari" within Birgunj or is a reference to five individual, named ponds that were illegally encroached upon around the same time. The Mairam Pokhari is the only one with a well-documented history of encroachment, but it is just one pond.
*   **Role of Bimal Prasad Shrivastav:** While he was the head of the local government at the time, no specific evidence has been found directly linking him to decisions or actions that led to the disappearance of the ponds. His role, whether through complicity, negligence, or direct involvement, is a primary subject for further investigation.
*   **Financial Loss:** The initial file estimates the loss at "billions" (अर्वौ). Given the historical land value, the encroachment of several large ponds in a prime commercial city like Birgunj could plausibly amount to such a figure, but this requires a formal valuation based on the exact area of the lost ponds.

This summary is based on the available public information. The core of the case—the specific event in 2043 BS and the identity of all five ponds—remains uncorroborated by the search results and requires deeper investigation, potentially through archival of municipal records, court documents, or land revenue office archives from that period.
