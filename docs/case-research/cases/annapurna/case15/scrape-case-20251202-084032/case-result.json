  "title": "Maoist Combatant Cantonment Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The Maoist Combatant Cantonment case concerns significant allegations of corruption and financial irregularities involving state funds disbursed by the Government of Nepal for the management of former Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA) combatants. Following the <strong>Comprehensive Peace Agreement on November 21, 2006</strong>, thousands of PLA combatants were housed in seven main and 21 satellite cantonments across Nepal, with their management monitored by the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN).</p><p>The central allegation is that the Maoist leadership systematically inflated the number of registered combatants to embezzle government funds. While the Maoist party initially claimed to have approximately 32,250 combatants, a formal verification process conducted by UNMIN in 2007 confirmed only <strong>19,602 individuals</strong>. The discrepancy between the reported numbers and the verified count forms the basis of the corruption charges, suggesting that funds for thousands of \"ghost\" or non-existent combatants were siphoned off by the leadership.</p><p>The controversy gained significant traction after a video, recorded in 2008 at the Shaktikhor cantonment, was leaked. In the video, then-Maoist Supreme Commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal (\"Prachanda\") appears to admit that the actual number of fighters was only around 7,000-8,000 and that the figures were deliberately inflated for strategic advantage in negotiations.</p><p>In 2012, a formal complaint was filed with the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) by the Youth Association Nepal (the youth wing of CPN-UML), accusing the Maoist leadership of embezzling at least <strong>NPR 4 billion</strong>. The CIAA initiated investigations multiple times, but the probe has repeatedly stalled, allegedly due to political pressure. The investigation lost its momentum after then-CIAA Chief Commissioner Lokman Singh Karki, who had aggressively pursued the case, was impeached and subsequently removed from his post by the Supreme Court in 2017. As of May 2023, there have been renewed public and political calls to reopen and conclude the investigation.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>An initial report associated with this case mentioned a loss amount of <strong>९९ अर्व ७१ करोड (99.71 billion NPR)</strong>. This figure has not been substantiated by any credible sources or official documents and appears to be a gross overestimation. The widely reported and officially investigated claim, as per the complaint filed at the CIAA, is for the embezzlement of approximately <strong>NPR 4 billion</strong>.</p>",
