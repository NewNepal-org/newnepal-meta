### **Description**

<p>The Maoist Combatant Cantonment case revolves around serious allegations of corruption and financial irregularities concerning funds disbursed by the Government of Nepal for the management of former Maoist rebels. Following the <strong>Comprehensive Peace Agreement on November 21, 2006 (Mangsir 5, 2063 BS)</strong>, the Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA) combatants were housed in seven main and 21 satellite cantonments across Nepal, under the monitoring of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN).</p><p>The core of the allegation is that the Maoist leadership systematically inflated the number of combatants to siphon off state funds. While the Maoists initially reported around 32,250 combatants, a verification process by UNMIN in 2007 confirmed only <strong>19,602 combatants</strong>. Later, during the integration process, the number of combatants present was even lower, at around 17,074, raising questions about where the funds for the "ghost" or absent combatants went. Allegations claim that the leadership drew salaries and ration allowances for thousands of combatants who had already left the camps.</p><p>The controversy was significantly fueled by a leaked video from a 2008 speech by Pushpa Kamal Dahal at the Shaktikhor cantonment. In the video, he appeared to suggest that the real number of combatants was only around 7,000-8,000 and that the numbers were deliberately inflated to 35,000 to strengthen their negotiating position.</p><p>In 2012, the youth wing of the CPN-UML party filed a formal complaint with the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), accusing the Maoist leadership, including Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai, of embezzling at least <strong>NPR 4 billion</strong>. The CIAA has opened investigations multiple times, notably in 2014 and 2016, even summoning leaders to provide evidence. However, the investigation has consistently stalled, with critics alleging that the case is used as a political tool to pressure the Maoist party rather than to pursue genuine accountability. The probe lost significant momentum after the then-CIAA Chief Lokman Singh Karki, who had aggressively reopened the case, was impeached and subsequently removed from office by the Supreme Court in 2017.</p><p>As of May 2023, following a major crackdown on the fake Bhutanese refugee scam, political opponents and the public have renewed calls to reopen and conclude the investigation into the cantonment funds.</p>
