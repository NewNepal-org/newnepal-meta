---

### **Summary of Allegations**

The case revolves around the construction of a substandard bridge at Jabdighat in Bardiya, which collapsed before its official handover to the government. The primary contractor, Pappu Construction Pvt. Ltd., owned by lawmaker Harinarayan Prasad Sah Rauniyar and his son Sumit Rauniyar, was accused by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) of using substandard materials, deviating from the approved design and specifications, and overall negligence. The investigation also implicated officials from the Division Road Office, Nepalgunj, alleging they colluded with the contractor by approving the questionable work and releasing payments without proper quality checks.

The bridge, which was a vital link between Gulariya, the district headquarters of Bardiya, and Barbardiya Municipality, buckled during floods in August 2017. The CIAA filed a corruption case at the Special Court in October 2018 against 12 individuals, including the Rauniyars and government officials. In May 2022, the Special Court found the Rauniyars and several officials guilty, imposing fines and prison sentences. The case has since been appealed and is pending at the Supreme Court.

### **Key Findings and Allegations**

*   **Substandard Construction:** The core allegation is that Pappu Construction used substandard materials and did not adhere to the bridge's design and specifications. An investigation found that the piles of the bridge were not built to the required depth, leading to cavities and the eventual collapse.
*   **Collusion with Officials:** The CIAA's charge sheet stated that technical staff and officials from the Division Road Office colluded with the contractor, approving flawed work and processing payments without ensuring quality.
*   **Premature Failure:** The bridge was visibly tilted even during construction and collapsed in August 2017 before it was completed and handed over to the government, sparking public outcry and a formal investigation. The 435-meter long bridge was meant to connect Gulariya with Barbardiya Municipality and the East-West Highway.
*   **Legal Consequences for Rauniyar:** As a sitting Member of Parliament, Harinarayan Rauniyar was automatically suspended from his duties upon the filing of the corruption case, in accordance with the Corruption Prevention Act, 2002.
*   **Ongoing Disruption:** As of late 2023, the bridge has not been repaired or reconstructed, forcing thousands of locals to rely on boats and temporary crossings, significantly hindering travel and access to the district headquarters. Plans for a new bridge are stalled due to bureaucratic and budgetary delays.
