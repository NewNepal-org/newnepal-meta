  "title": "Jabdighat Bridge Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>The Jabdighat Bridge Corruption Case involves the construction of a substandard bridge over the Babai River in Bardiya district, which collapsed in August 2017 before its official handover to the government. The bridge was a critical infrastructure project intended to connect Gulariya, the district headquarters, with Barbardiya Municipality.</p><p>The primary contractor, <strong>Pappu Construction Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, owned by then-lawmaker <strong>Harinarayan Prasad Sah Rauniyar</strong> and his son <strong>Sumit Rauniyar</strong>, was accused of gross negligence, using substandard materials, and deviating from the approved engineering design. An investigation by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) revealed that the bridge's piles were not built to the required depth, leading to its structural failure during floods.</p><p>The CIAA also implicated several officials from the <strong>Division Road Office, Nepalgunj</strong>, alleging they colluded with the contractor by approving the flawed construction and releasing payments without conducting proper quality checks. In October 2018, the CIAA filed a corruption case at the Special Court against 12 individuals, including the Rauniyars, government engineers, and a consultant.</p><p>Key outcomes of the case include:</p><ul><li>Harinarayan Rauniyar's automatic suspension from his post as a Member of Parliament upon the filing of the corruption case.</li><li>In May 2022, the <strong>Special Court</strong> found the Rauniyars and several government officials guilty. The court imposed significant fines on the father-son duo and handed down prison sentences and fines to a number of the accused officials.</li><li>Several accused individuals were acquitted by the Special Court.</li><li>The defendants have since appealed the verdict at the <strong>Supreme Court</strong>, where the case is currently pending.</li></ul><p>As of late 2023, the bridge has not been reconstructed, causing significant hardship for local residents who are forced to use boats or temporary crossings to access essential services.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There are several discrepancies in the financial figures reported across different sources. This information requires further verification.</p><ul><li><strong>Initial Contract Value:</strong> Sources cite varying amounts for the contract, including <strong>Rs 166.8 million</strong>, <strong>Rs 190.75 million</strong>, and <strong>Rs 165 million</strong>.</li><li><strong>Amount Claimed by CIAA:</strong> The amount the CIAA sought to recover from the accused also varies in reports. Figures include <strong>Rs 193,225,695</strong> each from Harinarayan and Sumit Rauniyar (totaling over Rs 380 million), and a separate figure of <strong>Rs 190.32 million</strong> from Harinarayan Rauniyar.</li><li><strong>Special Court Fine:</strong> There is conflicting information regarding the fine imposed on the Rauniyars by the Special Court on May 8, 2022. One source states the fine was <strong>Rs 72.40 million</strong> combined, while another indicates it was <strong>Rs 37.2 million</strong>.</li></ul>",
