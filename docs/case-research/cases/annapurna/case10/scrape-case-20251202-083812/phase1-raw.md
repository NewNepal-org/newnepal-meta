### **Description**

<p>The Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS), under the leadership of its then-chairman Sanjeev Thapa, became embroiled in a major corruption scandal involving allegations of widespread financial irregularities and the misuse of billions of rupees, particularly funds donated for the 2015 earthquake victims. Numerous investigations by government bodies and parliamentary committees were launched starting around 2018.</p>

<p>The core allegations state that the NRCS leadership, including Mr. Thapa and other officials like Umesh Prasad Dhakal, misappropriated funds intended for humanitarian aid, spending them on administrative overheads, luxury vehicles, and other non-approved expenses. The organization was also accused of running projects worth billions without seeking the necessary approvals from government regulatory bodies, operating with a lack of transparency, and defying government directives.</p>

<p>The scandal attracted international attention, with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launching its own internal investigation. In Nepal, the District Administration Office (DAO) of Kathmandu, the Social Welfare Council (SWC), and multiple parliamentary committees conducted probes. These investigations led to the government of Nepal dissolving the Thapa-led executive committee in July 2020 and appointing an ad-hoc committee to manage the organization. Despite these actions, legal battles and internal disputes over leadership have continued to plague the NRCS for years, affecting its operations and international standing.</p>

### **Unverified Information**

<p>The following information is based on media reports and requires further verification through official documents:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The exact, audited amount of total loss is difficult to ascertain, with figures in reports varying. While the initial document mentioned "over 16 billion," news reports cite different amounts, including "nearly Rs 16 billion" from unauthorized foreign aid, "Rs 9 billion" in misappropriated post-earthquake grants, and "over Rs 3 billion" misappropriated by the previous leadership. These figures appear to be estimates from various probe committees rather than a final, unified audit.</li>
    <li>While parliamentary committees recommended that the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) take action, the specific outcomes of any CIAA investigation, such as official charges filed or a final verdict from the Special Court against Sanjeev Thapa or Umesh Prasad Dhakal on these corruption allegations, are not detailed in the available sources.</li>
    <li>The Supreme Court, while allowing the Thapa committee to continue at one point to hold elections, noted that any allegations of corruption in land purchases or other activities could be prosecuted separately under the law, but the status of such a prosecution is unclear.</li>
</ul>
