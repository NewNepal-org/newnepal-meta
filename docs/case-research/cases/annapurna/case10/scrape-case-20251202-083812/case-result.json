  "title": "Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) Financial Irregularity and Corruption Case",
  "description": "<p>A major corruption scandal involving the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS), primarily under the leadership of former chairman Sanjeev Thapa. The case revolves around allegations of widespread financial irregularities, misuse of billions of rupees, and a lack of transparency, particularly concerning funds donated for victims of the 2015 earthquake.</p><p>Investigations launched around 2018 by multiple government bodies, including the District Administration Office (DAO) of Kathmandu, the Social Welfare Council (SWC), and several parliamentary committees, uncovered significant issues. The core allegations state that the NRCS leadership, including Thapa and former Executive Director Umesh Prasad Dhakal, misappropriated funds intended for humanitarian aid. These funds were allegedly diverted to cover administrative expenses, purchase luxury vehicles, and finance foreign trips.</p><p>Key findings from the probes include:</p><ul><li><strong>Unauthorized Spending:</strong> The NRCS was found to be running projects worth over <strong>Rs 5 billion</strong> without the necessary approvals from government regulatory bodies. Other reports suggest nearly <strong>Rs 16 billion</strong> from foreign donors was spent without government oversight.</li><li><strong>Misuse of Relief Funds:</strong> A sum of <strong>Rs 245 million</strong>, granted by donors for post-earthquake reconstruction, was reportedly spent on non-approved administrative activities.</li><li><strong>Procurement Corruption:</strong> Allegations include the embezzlement of <strong>Rs 210 million</strong> during a land purchase in Bhaktapur and collusion with contractors.</li></ul><p>The scandal prompted an internal investigation by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). In response to the findings, the Government of Nepal dissolved the Thapa-led executive committee on <strong>July 28, 2020</strong>, and appointed an ad-hoc committee. Despite this, legal battles and internal leadership disputes have continued, affecting the organization's operations and reputation.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is based on media reports and requires further verification through official documents:</p><ul><li>The exact, audited total amount of financial loss is difficult to ascertain, with figures in various reports fluctuating. While some reports mention 'nearly Rs 16 billion' in unauthorized foreign aid spending, others cite 'Rs 9 billion' in misappropriated grants, and 'over Rs 3 billion' misappropriated by the previous leadership. These figures appear to be estimates from different probe committees rather than a single, final, unified audit.</li><li>While parliamentary committees recommended that the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) take action, the specific outcomes of any CIAA investigation, such as official charges filed or a final verdict from the Special Court against Sanjeev Thapa or Umesh Prasad Dhakal on these specific corruption allegations, are not detailed in the available sources.</li><li>The Supreme Court, while at one point issuing an interim order allowing the Thapa-led committee to continue for the purpose of holding elections, noted that allegations of corruption could be prosecuted separately. The current status of any such specific prosecution remains unclear.</li></ul>",
