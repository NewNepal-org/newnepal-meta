  "description": "<p>The Kathmandu-Terai Fast Track, a national pride project managed by the <strong>Nepali Army (NA)</strong> since 2017, has been embroiled in significant allegations of corruption, procurement irregularities, and financial mismanagement. Multiple investigations by parliamentary committees and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) have highlighted systemic issues in the project's execution.</p><p><strong>Key Issues and Investigations:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Internal Army Probe (2019):</strong> Following complaints, the NA initiated an internal court of inquiry on October 18, 2019, which led to the suspension of then-project chief Brigadier General Sarad Lal Shrestha. Subsequent reports indicated the probe uncovered corruption amounting to 'billions of rupees' and implicated high-ranking officials, including former Chief of Army Staff <strong>Rajendra Chhetri</strong> and retired Major General <strong>Yogendra Bahadur Khand</strong>, in irregularities related to design, consultant selection, and tender awards.</li><li><strong>Procurement and Parliamentary Scrutiny (2021):</strong> The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Parliament investigated the procurement process for the project's second package (tunnels and bridges) following complaints that the tender process was manipulated to favor specific bidders. On April 1, 2021, the PAC directed the government to cancel the tender process. However, the NA <strong>defied this directive</strong>, arguing it had not received instructions from the Ministry of Defence, and awarded the contracts to two Chinese firms in May 2021.</li><li><strong>Auditor General's Findings:</strong> The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) has repeatedly flagged financial and procedural lapses.<ul><li>The 60th Annual Report (2023) questioned <strong>NPR 2.76 billion</strong> in expenditures by the NA on items not directly related to the project, such as vehicles, fuel, and administrative costs.</li><li>A June 2024 report revealed illegal payments of over <strong>$76,000</strong> to South Korean experts working on tourist visas, a violation of labor and immigration laws.</li><li>The OAG also highlighted the neglect of construction materials, noting that Bailey bridge parts worth <strong>NPR 78.51 million</strong> were left to rust at the Khokana project site.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Project Delays and Disputes:</strong> The project has suffered from significant delays, with the completion deadline extended multiple times, most recently to mid-April 2027. A persistent land acquisition dispute in <strong>Khokana, Lalitpur</strong>, has also stalled work at the expressway's designated starting point.</li></ul>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>This section contains claims and details that are mentioned in sources but have not been officially confirmed by a court of law or a final investigation report.</p><ul><li>The specific claim of financial irregularities amounting to <strong>'at least 6 arba' (NPR 6 billion)</strong> is a general allegation and has not been substantiated by a precise, official figure from an investigative body, although reports of corruption worth 'billions' exist.</li><li>An allegation reported in the media claims that the selection of Chinese companies was influenced by Mr. Rajan Rayamajhi, described as a 'near and dear one of a high-ranking NA official,' but this has not been officially proven.</li><li>The final outcome of the Nepali Army's internal investigation from 2019, including what specific actions were taken against the implicated high-ranking officials like former CoAS <strong>Rajendra Chhetri</strong> and retired Major General <strong>Yogendra Bahadur Khand</strong>, has not been made fully public.</li></ul>",
