### **Description of Events**

<p>The Kathmandu-Terai Fast Track, a national pride project managed by the Nepali Army (NA) since 2017, has been plagued by significant allegations of corruption, irregularities in procurement, and mismanagement. The issues have drawn scrutiny from parliamentary committees and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), leading to multiple investigations and public disputes.</p>

<p><strong>Key Allegations and Investigations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Internal Army Probe (2019):</strong> In October 2019, the NA initiated an internal investigation led by Major General Sharad Giri following complaints of irregularities. The probe suspended the then-project chief, Brigadier General Sarad Lal Shrestha. Reports from the investigation revealed high-level corruption involving former Chief of Army Staff Rajendra Chhetri and retired Major General Yogendra Bahadur Khand. The irregularities were linked to preparing designs, selecting consultants, and awarding tenders for the track opening, with the corruption estimated to be in the "billions of rupees".</li>
    <li><strong>Parliamentary Scrutiny over Contract Award (2021):</strong> The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the House of Representatives began investigating the contract award process for the project's second package, which included tunnels and bridges. The committee received numerous complaints alleging that the NA had tailored procurement procedures to favor specific bidders. Out of 21 bidders for one part of the tender, only one, China's Poly Changda Engineering Co. Ltd., was pre-qualified, raising suspicions.</li>
    <li><strong>Defiance of Parliamentary Directive:</strong> On April 1, 2021, the PAC directed the government to cancel the tender process for the second package and initiate a new one due to the suspected irregularities. However, the NA defied this directive. The army argued that the directive was for the government, and since the Ministry of Defence had not instructed them to stop, they proceeded with the contract award as per the Public Procurement Act. In May 2021, the NA officially awarded the contracts to two Chinese firms: Poly Chhangda Engineering Company and China State Construction Engineering Corporation.</li>
    <li><strong>Auditor General's Reports:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The OAG's 60th Annual Report (2023) questioned NPR 2.76 billion in expenditures by the NA on items not directly related to the fast track project. These expenses included vehicles, fuel, administrative costs, and camp construction. The report noted this amount was 8.04% of the total project expenditure at the time.</li>
            <li>A subsequent OAG report in June 2024 revealed that the NA had illegally paid over $76,000 to South Korean experts who were working on tourist visas, a violation of immigration and labor laws.</li>
            <li>The OAG also highlighted mismanagement of construction materials, noting that three sets of Bailey bridges worth NPR 78.51 million were left to rust and degrade at a project site instead of being properly used or stored.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other Major Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Project Delays:</strong> The project has faced multiple deadline extensions. Initially scheduled for completion by 2021, the deadline was pushed to December 2024 and subsequently to mid-April 2027. As of May 2025, physical progress was only at 39.34%.</li>
    <li><strong>Khokana Land Dispute:</strong> A persistent land acquisition dispute in Khokana, the designated starting point of the expressway, has severely hampered progress. Local residents have protested the route, citing threats to religious and cultural heritage sites, and disagreements over compensation have stalled all work under Package 11 of the project.</li>
</ul>

### **Unverified Information**

<p>This section includes claims and details that are mentioned in sources but are not yet officially confirmed by a court of law or a final investigation report.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The specific claim in the initial document of "at least 6 arba" (NPR 6 billion) in losses is a general allegation and has not been substantiated by a precise, official figure from an investigative body, although reports of "billions" in corruption exist.</li>
    <li>The allegation that the selection of Chinese companies was directly influenced by Mr. Rajan Rayamajhi, mentioned as a "near and dear one of a high-ranking NA official," is a claim reported in the media but has not been officially proven.</li>
    <li>The final outcome of the NA's internal investigation from 2019, including what specific actions were taken against the implicated high-ranking officials like former CoAS Rajendra Chhetri, has not been made fully public. The Army Act allows for action against retired officials within six months, but the final disposition of the case against Chhetri and Khand remains unclear.</li>
