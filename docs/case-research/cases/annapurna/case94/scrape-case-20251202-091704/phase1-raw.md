Here are the raw findings regarding the railway contract case of 2077 BS, based on the available sources.

***

### **Case Details**

*   **Case Name:** Inaruwa-Kakarbhitta Railway Trackbed Tender
*   **Year:** 2020 (2077 BS)
*   **Subject:** Alleged corruption and procedural irregularities in the tender process for the construction of a railway trackbed.
*   **Amount:** Approximately NPR 33 to 35 billion. This was the estimated value of the tender, not a confirmed loss, as the contract was ultimately cancelled.
*   **Project:** Construction of the 106-kilometer Inaruwa-Kakarbhitta section of the Mechi-Mahakali (East-West) Electric Railway.

### **Timeline of Events**

*   **June 6, 2020:** The District Administration Office, Jhapa, published a 35-day notice for land acquisition for the project.
*   **June 9, 2020:** A similar notice for land acquisition was published for Morang and Sunsari districts.
*   **June/July 2020 (Asar 2077 BS):** The Department of Railways issued a public tender invitation for the construction of the railway trackbed (earthwork) for the Inaruwa-Kakarbhitta section, divided into 54 separate packages.
*   **September 8, 2020:** The Department of Railways published a public notice announcing the cancellation of the tender process (bids 2(2076/77 and 3(2076/77).

### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

#### **Primary Allegation: Violation of Public Procurement Act**

The central issue was the Department of Railways calling for a multi-billion rupee construction tender before completing legally mandated preliminary work. This was in direct violation of the Public Procurement Act, as well as directives from the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the Office of the Auditor General, and parliamentary committees.

The required preliminary work that was not completed included:
*   **Land Acquisition:** The land for the railway track had not been acquired from private owners. While notices were sent out freezing land transactions for around 5,424 plots in Jhapa, Morang, and Sunsari, compensation had not been paid.
*   **Site Clearance:** The physical "site" for construction was not clear. This includes the lack of land acquisition and the failure to secure environmental clearances.
*   **Environmental Clearances:** The project lacked the required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE).
*   **Permission to Cut Trees:** The Ministry of Forests and Environment had not granted permission to cut down the more than 800 trees located on the proposed path.

#### **Allegations of Collusion and Corruption**

Multiple sources reported a coordinated plan to embezzle state funds through collusion among contractors with political and bureaucratic backing.

*   **Contractor Collusion:** It was alleged that the Federation of Contractors' Associations of Nepal (FCAN) orchestrated a collusion campaign. Around 18 "A-class" contracting companies allegedly distributed the 54 tender packages among themselves and their joint-venture partners to eliminate genuine competition. The plan was to submit bids that were only 1% to 1.5% below the government's estimated cost, ensuring an inflated price.
*   **Barring Competition:** The project was deliberately broken down into 54 small packages. This, combined with a requirement for prior experience in trackbed projects, was designed to disqualify international bidders and around 150 domestic companies, thereby limiting the pool to a pre-selected group of contractors.
*   **Planned Embezzlement:** Reports suggested a plan to embezzle as much as NPR 10 billion from the contract. This involved collusion between business people, senior officials in the Prime Minister's Office, the CIAA, parliamentary committees, and the Department of Railways.
*   **"Site Clear" Scheme:** The core of the corrupt plan was to award the contract without a clear site. This would allow contractors to claim compensation from the government for delays, as they would be unable to begin work. This tactic is a known method for draining state funds on stalled projects.

#### **Cancellation of the Tender**

The tender process was ultimately cancelled. The cancellation was attributed to several factors:

1.  **Internal Opposition:** Employees within the Department of Railways, particularly those on the bid evaluation committee, refused to approve the tender. In an act described as a "revolt," they formally advised the department that the bids could not be accepted, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and the impossibility of clearing the site as official reasons. They reportedly feared that approving an illegal tender would tarnish their careers and expose them to future prosecution.
2.  **Media Exposure:** News outlets, specifically *Naya Patrika* and its English-language counterpart *Nagarik*, published a series of investigative articles exposing the irregularities and alleged corruption, which fueled public outcry.
3.  **Political Pressure:** Following the public outcry and media reports, the Department of Railways reportedly cancelled the contract under the direction of then-Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli.

### **Involved Individuals and Entities**

*   **Department of Railways:** The government entity that called and subsequently cancelled the tender.
*   **Balaram Mishra:** Director-General of the Department of Railways at the time. Sources claimed he was attempting to finalize the contract before his retirement on October 6, 2020. He was reportedly not a member of the bid evaluation committee, which was seen as a strategic move to distance himself from the decision and evade direct responsibility.
*   **Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal (FCAN):** Allegedly led the collusion effort among construction companies.
*   **18 "A-Class" Contracting Companies:** An unnamed group of contractors who allegedly colluded to divide the 54 tender packages among themselves.

### **Impact on Landowners**

While the corrupt tender was averted, the associated land acquisition process caused significant hardship for thousands of families in Jhapa, Morang, and Sunsari districts.

*   The government froze transactions on an estimated 5,424 plots of land along the proposed railway route.
*   For over two years, landowners were unable to sell their land or use it as collateral for loans, causing severe financial distress, even in emergencies.
*   The government neither paid the required compensation for the land nor released the land from the freeze, leaving approximately 5,000 families in a state of uncertainty. The estimated compensation for the land alone was projected to be over NPR 24 billion.
