  "title": "Inaruwa-Kakarbhitta Railway Trackbed Tender Irregularities",
  "description": "<p>In mid-2020, the Department of Railways initiated a massive tender process, valued at an estimated NPR 33-35 billion, for the construction of a 106-kilometer railway trackbed for the Inaruwa-Kakarbhitta section of the Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway. The tender was divided into 54 separate packages.</p><p>The primary issue was the <strong>violation of the Public Procurement Act</strong>, as the tender was called before legally mandated preliminary work was completed. This went against directives from the CIAA, the Office of the Auditor General, and parliamentary committees. The prerequisite work not completed included:</p><ul><li><strong>Land Acquisition:</strong> Land for the track had not been acquired from private owners, and compensation was not paid.</li><li><strong>Site Clearance:</strong> The physical site for construction was not available due to the lack of land acquisition and environmental clearances.</li><li><strong>Environmental Clearances:</strong> The required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) were not secured.</li><li><strong>Permission to Cut Trees:</strong> No permission was granted by the Ministry of Forests and Environment to clear vegetation from the proposed route.</li></ul><p>Allegations of widespread corruption and collusion surfaced, reportedly orchestrated by the <strong>Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal (FCAN)</strong>. It was claimed that a group of 'A-class' contractors planned to divide the 54 packages among themselves, eliminating genuine competition and submitting bids only slightly below the government's estimate to ensure inflated prices. The strategy was allegedly to secure the contracts without a clear site, which would allow them to claim compensation from the government for project delays, a known tactic for draining state funds.</p><p>The tender was ultimately cancelled on September 8, 2020. The cancellation was attributed to a combination of factors:</p><ol><li><strong>Internal Opposition:</strong> The bid evaluation committee within the Department of Railways reportedly refused to approve the illegal tender, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and the impossibility of site clearance.</li><li><strong>Media Exposure:</strong> Investigative reports, notably by <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/how-a-multi-billion-rupee-railway-trackbed-corruption-scam-was-exposed-and-ultimately-brought-down/\">Naya Patrika and Nagarik</a>, exposed the irregularities and fueled public outcry.</li><li><strong>Political Pressure:</strong> Following the media reports, the contract was reportedly cancelled under the direction of the Prime Minister's office.</li></ol><p>While the allegedly corrupt tender was averted, the land acquisition process caused significant hardship for thousands of families in Jhapa, Morang, and Sunsari districts. The government froze transactions on an estimated 5,424 plots of land, leaving approximately 5,000 families unable to sell their land or use it as collateral for over two years, without receiving any compensation.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>Several claims and details in this case are based on media reports and have not been officially verified by a court or investigative body.</p><ul><li><strong>Planned Embezzlement Amount:</strong> News reports suggested a plan to embezzle as much as <strong>NPR 10 billion</strong> from the contract through collusion, but this figure is an allegation and not a confirmed amount.</li><li><strong>Involved Entities:</strong> It was alleged that the scheme involved collusion between business people and senior officials in the <strong>Prime Minister's Office, the CIAA, and parliamentary committees</strong>. However, no specific officials have been publicly named or charged.</li><li><strong>Colluding Contractors:</strong> Around <strong>18 'A-class' contracting companies</strong> allegedly colluded to divide the 54 tender packages. The specific names of these companies are not publicly known.</li><li><strong>Role of Director-General:</strong> It was reported that Director-General Balaram Mishra was attempting to finalize the contract before his retirement on October 6, 2020. The reports also suggested that his absence from the bid evaluation committee was a strategic move to evade direct responsibility. These claims about his motives and strategy remain unverified.</li></ul>",
