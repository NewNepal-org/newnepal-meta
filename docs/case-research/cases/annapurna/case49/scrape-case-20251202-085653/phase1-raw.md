### **Description of Events**

<p>The "Omni Scandal" refers to major irregularities in a contract awarded by the Nepal government to <strong>Omni Business Corporate International (OBCI)</strong> for the emergency procurement of medical supplies in March 2020, during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The deal, valued at over NPR 1.24 billion (approximately $10 million USD), was for items including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), N95 masks, and testing kits. The contract was awarded without a competitive bidding process, with the government citing emergency powers.</p><p>Allegations of corruption surfaced almost immediately, centering on several key issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Inflated Prices:</strong> Omni charged prices significantly higher than market rates. For example, N95 masks were priced at Rs 828.67 each, compared to a market rate of Rs 462.50, and non-contact thermometers were procured at Rs 7,500 against a market price of around Rs 4,000. Some reports claimed prices were three times higher than those offered by other suppliers.</li><li><strong>Irregular Process:</strong> The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found that the decision was driven by then-Health Minister Bhanubhakta Dhakal and his chief advisor, Dr. Khem Karki. Dr. Karki, who allegedly had no legal authority in procurement, led the negotiations and recommended Omni. The PAC report concluded the deal was illegal and contravened the Public Procurement Act.</li><li><strong>Lack of Qualification:</strong> Omni Group had no prior experience in supplying medical equipment and reportedly did not have the necessary tax clearance certificates at the time of the agreement.</li><li><strong>Substandard and Failed Deliveries:</strong> Omni only delivered about 10% of the promised goods. Critically, the 75,000 Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits it supplied were later found by the Nepal Health Research Council to be of inferior quality, with only 50% effectiveness. Some supplied PCR machines were also reported as counterfeit or incompatible.</li></ul><p>Amid widespread public and media outcry, the Department of Health Services (DoHS) <strong>cancelled the contract on April 1, 2020</strong>, citing Omni's failure to deliver the required supplies on time. The government also decided to seize the company's security deposit of Rs 50 million. Subsequently, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office blacklisted Omni Group for one year, a penalty considered lenient by some, as it did not account for the supply of substandard goods. The PAC conducted a thorough investigation, concluding there was corruption, and formally requested the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) to launch a probe and take legal action against those involved.</p>

### **Unverified Information**

<p>The following information is based on claims reported in the media but may not be fully verified through official documents:</p><ul><li>The initial markdown file mentions a total loss of <strong>1 arba 25 karod (NPR 1.25 billion)</strong>. This figure aligns with the reported contract value but the exact amount of "loss" through corruption has not been officially quantified by a court. The contract was worth over NPR 1.24 billion.</li><li>Media reports suggest that Omni Group secured the deal due to its close connections with high-level officials, specifically mentioning a person linked to the company, Yubaraj Sharma, having close relations with then-Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.</li><li>While the PAC concluded there was corruption and referred the case to the CIAA, the final outcome of the CIAA investigation and whether it led to any legal prosecution against the implicated officials is not detailed in the available sources. Reports from 2021 suggested the investigation had stalled.</li></ul>
