  "title": "Omni Group Medical Procurement Scandal",
  "description": "<p>The \"Omni Scandal\" involves significant irregularities in an emergency contract awarded by Nepal's Ministry of Health and Population to <strong>Omni Business Corporate International (OBCI) Pvt. Ltd.</strong> in March 2020 for the procurement of medical supplies during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The contract, valued at over <strong>NPR 1.24 billion</strong> (approximately $10 million USD), was for critical items such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), N95 masks, and testing kits.</p><p>The deal was pushed through without a competitive bidding process, citing emergency provisions. However, allegations of corruption emerged almost immediately due to several key issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Inflated Prices:</strong> Omni charged prices significantly higher than market rates. For instance, N95 masks were procured at Rs 828.67 each, while the market rate was around Rs 462.50. Non-contact thermometers were bought for Rs 7,500 against a market price of approximately Rs 4,000.</li><li><strong>Irregular Process:</strong> The parliamentary <strong>Public Accounts Committee (PAC)</strong> found that the procurement decision was driven by then-Health Minister Bhanubhakta Dhakal and his chief advisor, Dr. Khem Karki, who allegedly lacked the legal authority to lead negotiations. The PAC concluded the process violated the Public Procurement Act.</li><li><strong>Lack of Qualification:</strong> Omni Group had no prior experience in supplying medical equipment and reportedly failed to submit a valid tax clearance certificate at the time of the agreement.</li><li><strong>Failed and Substandard Deliveries:</strong> Omni delivered only about 10% of the goods. Furthermore, the 75,000 Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits it supplied were later found by the Nepal Health Research Council to be of inferior quality and low effectiveness.</li></ul><p>Following intense public and media pressure, the Department of Health Services (DoHS) <strong>cancelled the contract on April 1, 2020</strong>, citing Omni's failure to deliver supplies on time. The government seized the company's Rs 50 million security deposit. Subsequently, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office blacklisted Omni Group for one year. The PAC's investigation concluded that corruption had occurred and formally instructed the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) to investigate and prosecute those responsible.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is based on claims reported in the media but has not been fully verified through official court or investigative documents:</p><ul><li>While the contract value was over NPR 1.24 billion, the exact financial loss to the state due to corruption has not been officially quantified by a court or investigative body.</li><li>Media reports suggested that Omni Group secured the deal due to its close political connections. Specifically, Yubaraj Sharma, a person linked to the company, was alleged to have close relations with then-Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.</li><li>The final outcome of the CIAA investigation remains unclear. Despite the PAC's formal request for a probe in December 2020, reports from April 2021 indicated that the investigation had stalled, with no public information available on whether legal action was taken against the implicated officials.</li></ul>",
