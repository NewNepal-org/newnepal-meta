### **Summary**

*   **`description`**:
    <p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case on February 25, 2022 (2078 Falgun 13), at the Special Court in Kathmandu against eight individuals, including the then Deputy Mayor of Baglung Municipality, Surendra Khadka. The case pertained to the construction of the modern bus park in Dabgahra, Baglung Municipality-4.</p>
    <p>The core allegation was that the accused had caused a loss of <strong>NPR 590,509</strong> to the government by falsifying records. The CIAA claimed that the accused colluded to approve payments for construction work that was never actually performed. This was allegedly achieved by making "unusual changes" to the project's measurement book (नापी किताब), creating a false report indicating work was complete, and recommending payment based on this fraudulent documentation.</p>
    <p>The case was filed against members of the project's monitoring committee, municipal officials, and the user committee responsible for the construction.</p>
    <p>However, on <strong>September 10, 2023</strong>, approximately a year and a half after the case was filed, the Special Court acquitted all eight accused individuals. The verdict was delivered by a judicial bench comprising judges Yamuna Bhattarai and Khusi Prasad Tharu.</p>

*   **`unverified_info`**:
    <p>One source mentioned the case filing date as 2078 Falgun 18 (March 2, 2022), which contradicts the Falgun 13 (February 25, 2022) date cited by two other sources.</p>
    <p>As of September 2023, despite construction being finished for two years, the bus park was reportedly still not operational due to unresolved issues related to land management and road access.</p>
