  "description": "<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case on <strong>February 25, 2022</strong>, against eight individuals, including the then Deputy Mayor of Baglung Municipality, Surendra Khadka. The case concerned alleged irregularities in the construction of a modern bus park in Dabgahra, Baglung Municipality-4.</p><p>The primary allegation was that the accused colluded to cause a loss of <strong>NPR 590,509</strong> to the government by falsifying project documents. The CIAA claimed that the officials and user committee members made unauthorized changes to the project's measurement book (नापी किताब), created a false completion report for work that was never performed, and recommended payment based on this fraudulent documentation.</p><p>The case implicated members of the project's monitoring committee, municipal officials, and the construction users' committee.</p><p>On <strong>September 10, 2023</strong>, the Special Court in Kathmandu, with a bench comprising judges Yamuna Bhattarai and Khusi Prasad Tharu, acquitted all eight individuals accused in the case, clearing them of all corruption charges.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>There is a discrepancy in the exact date the case was filed. While most sources cite <strong>February 25, 2022 (2078 Falgun 13)</strong>, at least one source, Annapurna Post, reported the filing date as <strong>March 2, 2022 (2078 Falgun 18)</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, it was reported in September 2023 that despite the construction having been completed for two years, the bus park was still not operational. The delay was attributed to unresolved issues concerning land management and road access.</p>",
