  "title": "Carpet Scandal (Galaincha Kanda) of 1977-78",
  "description": "<p>The Carpet Scandal (गलैचा काण्ड), also known as the Garment Scandal, was the first major corruption case investigated by Nepal's newly formed Commission for Control of Abuse of Authority (अख्तियार दुरुपयोग निवारण आयोग) in 1978. The case revolved around allegations of widespread corruption, specifically <strong>overinvoicing in the carpet and garment export industry</strong> during the Panchayat era.</p><p>The central figure implicated was the then-Prime Minister, <strong>Dr. Tulsi Giri</strong>, who served from December 1, 1975, to September 12, 1977. His cabinet was unexpectedly dissolved by a palace notice on September 9, 1977. Investigations reportedly began as early as 1976.</p><p>A total of <strong>91 individuals</strong>, described as \"bigwigs including politicians, businessmen, and bureaucrats,\" were implicated. Another source suggests that <strong>125 persons</strong> were investigated, specifically naming then-Finance Minister <strong>Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani</strong> alongside Dr. Giri.</p><p>Dr. Giri publicly denied the allegations, framing them as a conspiracy and famously stating he was \"ready to be hanged if corruption charges against him were proven.\" Despite the charges being filed in 1978, he was brought back into active politics for the 1979 referendum campaign.</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> According to an academic journal citing a 2003 publication, the accused individuals, including Dr. Giri, were granted bail shortly after being charged and were ultimately found \"free from guilt\" and acquitted.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The following information is from secondary sources, primarily blog posts, and lacks corroboration from official documents or mainstream news reports from the period:</p><ul><li>It is alleged that the scandal specifically involved a scheme of 'overinvoicing' exports to illegally obtain foreign currency or export incentives.</li><li>A blog post from 2005 speculates that Dr. Giri was advised to leave the country because he \"knew too much who else in the higher ups were also involved\". The same source claims that the only immediate consequence for him was the loss of his Prime Minister post.</li><li>Following the scandal and his brief return for the 1979 referendum, Dr. Giri reportedly became disillusioned with the Panchayat regime. He later moved to Sri Lanka for two years and then settled in Bangalore, India, before returning to Nepal in 2005.</li></ul>",
