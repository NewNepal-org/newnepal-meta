### **4. General Context and Other Incidents**

Research indicates that irregularities in social security allowance distribution are a systemic issue.

*   **Office of the Auditor General Report (2020-21):** The OAG's annual report highlighted that 216 local levels had improperly distributed approximately <strong>NPR 65.4 million</strong>. Common issues included issuing multiple ID cards to the same beneficiary and failing to remove deceased persons from the records.
*   **Rautahat (Gaur Municipality, 2017):** A major scam was reported involving the embezzlement of <strong>NPR 30 million</strong> over three fiscal years. A nexus of municipality staff, including a non-gazetted officer and an information officer, and bank staff were allegedly involved in issuing cards to at least 500 disqualified people.
*   **Panchthar (Phiddim Municipality, 2018):** The CIAA opened an investigation into a municipality account officer, Pemba Sherpa, for transferring social security funds from the bank accounts of deceased individuals into his personal account.
