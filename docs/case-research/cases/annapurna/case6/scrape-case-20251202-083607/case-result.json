  "title": "Misuse of Diplomatic Passports by Constituent Assembly Members (2011)",
  "description": "<p>This case revolves around the widespread misuse of diplomatic 'red' passports by several members of Nepal's first Constituent Assembly (CA). The core allegation is that these lawmakers provided their passports to a human trafficking ring, which then altered the documents to send people illegally to countries like Australia. The scheme involved replacing the passport holder's photograph with that of the person being trafficked, while keeping the official details intact, leveraging the easier visa processing afforded to diplomatic passport holders.</p><p>The scandal came to public attention in January 2011 when two individuals, <strong>Prithivi Chantyal</strong> and <strong>Sita Shah</strong>, were caught at Abu Dhabi's airport while en route to Australia. They were traveling on tampered diplomatic passports belonging to then-lawmakers <strong>Vishwanath Prasad Yadav</strong> and <strong>Gayatri Sah</strong>, respectively. After being deported back to Nepal on January 18, 2011, they were handed over to the immigration office at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). Reports indicate that instead of being immediately prosecuted, they were released by immigration officials in Kathmandu, suggesting collusion.</p><p>Subsequent investigations were launched by the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The CIB arrested lawmakers Gayatri Sah and Vishwanath Prasad Yadav on April 19, 2011. The CIAA later filed a corruption case at the Special Court on April 28, 2011, against multiple lawmakers and alleged middlemen.</p><p>The allegations included:</p><ul><li><strong>Shivpujan Ray Yadav's</strong> passport was allegedly used by a person named Kedar Nath Sharma to travel to Australia.</li><li><strong>Vishwanath Prasad Yadav's</strong> passport was used by Prithivi Chantyal.</li><li><strong>Gayatri Sah's</strong> passport was used by Sita Shah.</li><li><strong>Naradmuni Rana's</strong> passport was allegedly used by Nirmal Baniya to fly to Australia.</li></ul><p>The Kathmandu District Court convicted ex-lawmakers Gayatri Sah, Shivpujan Yadav, and Bishwonath Prasad Yadav on June 5, 2014. A separate corruption case at the Special Court also convicted Shivpujan Ray Yadav, Vishwanath Prasad Yadav, and Gayatri Sah, sentencing them to three months in prison and a NPR 15,000 fine, while acquitting others. The CIAA appealed the acquittals and lenient sentences to the Supreme Court on May 22, 2016, where the case remains sub-judice.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>The information provided in some initial reports contained details that could not be fully verified or appear to be conflated with other cases.</p><ul><li><strong>Year 2057 BS (2000/2001):</strong> The research strongly indicates the main scandal involving Shivpujan Ray and Vishwanath Prasad Yadav occurred around 2011. There was another passport scandal in 2057 BS, but it reportedly involved different politicians and was investigated by a different committee. The initial file may have merged these two separate events.</li><li><strong>Loss Amount of \"२ करोड ७३ लाख\" (NPR 27.3 Million):</strong> This specific figure was not found in any of the researched articles related to this particular case. While one individual, Prithivi Chantyal, admitted to paying agents NPR 1.6 Crore (16 million), a total loss or transaction amount of exactly NPR 27.3 million could not be verified for this case.</li></ul>",
