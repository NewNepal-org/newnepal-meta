Here are the comprehensive raw findings regarding the " मिटरब्याज पिडित" (Meter Interest Victims) case in Nepal.

### **Case Summary**

The case concerns widespread predatory lending practices in Nepal, known as "meter interest" (मिटरब्याज), where loan sharks charge exorbitant interest rates to vulnerable and often illiterate individuals. This systemic issue has led to thousands of victims losing their land, property, and falling into a vicious cycle of debt. Victims have organized large-scale protests, alleging that the legal system was being manipulated by perpetrators and failed to protect them, prompting significant government intervention, including new legislation and the formation of inquiry commissions.

### **Facts, Allegations, and Claims**

#### **Allegations against Lenders (Loan Sharks)**
*   **Exorbitant Interest Rates:** Lenders provide loans at excessively high interest rates, far exceeding the legal limits.
*   **Fraudulent Documentation:** Lenders are accused of creating fraudulent loan documents (*tamdeedsuk*). This includes:
    *   Inflating the principal amount in the written document beyond the actual sum given to the borrower.
    *   Forcing borrowers to sign blank papers or checks, which are later filled in with fraudulent amounts.
    *   Not providing receipts for repayments made by the borrowers.
*   **Coercion and Threats:** Using threats, violence, and exploitation to intimidate borrowers.
*   **Property Seizure:** Illegally seizing the debtor's immovable property, often by forcing them to sign over land deeds as collateral, and then refusing to return the property even after the loan (and excessive interest) has been paid off. One specific allegation involves borrowers taking loans of five lakh rupees, repaying 21 lakh rupees, and still not having their land returned.
*   **Legal Manipulation:** Using the fraudulent documents to file legal cases against the victims, such as check bouncing, to further entrap them.
*   **Other Exploitation:** In some cases, lenders are accused of forcing debtors into unpaid labor or even sexual exploitation.

#### **Victims' Claims and Protests**
*   **Government Inaction:** Victims have repeatedly accused the government of ignoring their suffering and failing to take adequate action against predatory lenders.
*   **"The Law is in Favor of the Perpetrator":** The core grievance of the victims was that the legal and administrative system favored the lenders. This was due to the lenders' use of legally-binding but fraudulently created documents, which made it difficult for victims to prove the crime, placing the burden of proof on the often-illiterate borrower.
*   **Mass Protests:** To make their voices heard, victims organized multiple long marches from various districts (including Mahottari, Siraha, Jhapa, and Kanchanpur) to the capital, Kathmandu, where they staged prolonged sit-in protests.

#### **Government Actions and Responses**
*   **Criminalization of Usury:** Following protests, the government declared "meter interest" a crime.
*   **Legislation:**
    *   An ordinance was issued on May 5, 2023, to amend the Muluki Civil Code, criminalizing usurious lending.
    *   The House of Representatives passed the "Bill to amend some Nepal Acts related to the Civil Code, 2080 BS" in July 2023.
    *   The bill was authenticated by the President on **2023-07-28**, officially making it law.
*   **Legal Penalties:** The new law imposes a penalty of up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to Rs 70,000 for those found guilty of usurious lending.
*   **Inquiry Commissions:**
    *   A "Meterbadge Crime Control Recommendation Task Force" was formed, and its report dated **2022-09-12** was a key reference in later agreements.
    *   An Inquiry Commission led by retired judge Gauri Bahadur Karki was established. It received nearly 24,000 complaints from victims.
    *   The government and victim representatives signed multiple agreements (e.g., a 5-point agreement on **2023-04-01** and a 4-point agreement in **March 2024**) to address the issue, often leading to the withdrawal of protests. These agreements included commitments to form commissions, recommend legal changes, and establish district-level coordination committees.

### **Timeline of Events**
