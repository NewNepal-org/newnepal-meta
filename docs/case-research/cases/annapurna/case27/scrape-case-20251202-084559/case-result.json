  "title": "Nepal Meter Interest (Usury) Scandal and Legislative Response",
  "description": "<p>This case details the systemic issue of predatory lending, known as <strong>\"meter interest\" (मिटरब्याज)</strong>, in Nepal, where loan sharks charge exorbitant interest rates to vulnerable individuals. The practice has led to thousands of victims losing their property, primarily land, and being trapped in a cycle of debt. The perpetrators are accused of using fraudulent methods to secure loans and seize assets, often with impunity.</p><p>Key methods employed by lenders include:</p><ul><li>Inflating the principal loan amount on official documents (<em>tamdeedsuk</em>).</li><li>Forcing borrowers to sign blank papers or checks.</li><li>Refusing to provide receipts for repayments.</li><li>Using threats and coercion to intimidate debtors.</li><li>Illegally seizing property used as collateral, even after the loan has been repaid multiple times over.</li></ul><p>The victims, many of whom are illiterate and from marginalized communities, organized large-scale protests, including long marches from various districts to the capital, Kathmandu. They staged prolonged sit-in demonstrations, claiming that the legal system was being manipulated by lenders and that the government had failed to protect them. Their core grievance was that the burden of proof lay on the victim, who had often been tricked into signing fraudulent but legally-binding documents.</p><p>In response to sustained pressure from the victims' protests, the Government of Nepal took several significant steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Formation of Inquiry Commissions:</strong> A task force was formed in 2022, followed by a high-level Inquiry Commission headed by retired judge Gauri Bahadur Karki, which received nearly 24,000 complaints.</li><li><strong>Agreements with Victims:</strong> The government entered into multiple agreements with victim representatives, promising legal reforms and justice mechanisms.</li><li><strong>Criminalization of Usury:</strong> The practice of \"meter interest\" was declared a crime. A bill was passed by Parliament and authenticated by the President on <strong>July 28, 2023</strong>, amending the Muluki Civil Code. The new law imposes a penalty of up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to Rs 70,000 for usurious lending.</li></ol><p>Despite these measures, victims have continued to protest, alleging that the implementation of the law and the agreements has been slow and ineffective, and that many perpetrators have not been brought to justice.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While the scale of the problem is known to be massive, precise aggregate financial data is not available.</p><ul><li>The total financial loss incurred by all victims across the country has not been officially quantified. The Karki-led commission received almost <strong>24,000 complaints</strong>, indicating a widespread crisis.</li><li>Specific details on the full extent of property and funds recovered versus the total amount illegally seized by lenders are not compiled in a single report. There are anecdotal reports of success, such as the return of 8 bigha (5.42 hectares) of land in some cases, but this is not comprehensive data.</li><li>Allegations of sexual exploitation and forced labor by lenders have been made but are not detailed in the provided reports.</li></ul>",
