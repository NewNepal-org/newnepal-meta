### **Case ID: 14 (Pashupati Area Development Trust - Sand Mining Corruption)**

**case_name:** Illegal Sand Mining on Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) Land

**status:** Closed (Court Verdict Issued)

**summary:**
<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against nine individuals, including former member secretaries of the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), former Local Development Officers (LDOs) of Kathmandu, and contractors. The accusation centered on the illegal awarding of a contract to excavate sand from 534 ropanis of PADT-owned land in Gothatar, Kathmandu.</p><p>The CIAA alleged that officials colluded to award the contract to CN Construction without following the due process, at a rate significantly below market price, causing a loss of NPR 465.4 million to the state. The investigation claimed that officials abused their authority for personal gain, allowed excavation without a proper environmental impact assessment, and permitted more sand to be extracted than was agreed upon in the contract.</p><p>In August 2016, the Special Court acquitted all seven public officials charged in the case, including the former PADT member secretaries and LDOs, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. However, the court convicted two contractors, Bachchuram Dahal and Mitharam Dahal, imposing significant fines.</p>

**description:**
<p>The case involves the illegal excavation and sale of sand from land belonging to the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), a public entity, located in Gothatar-3, Kathmandu. The issue came to public and legal attention around March 2010 after news reports exposed the activity. The core of the allegation was that PADT officials sold sand to a contractor at a price approximately five times lower than the prevailing market rate for a period of 18 months.</p><p>The PADT was selling a truckload of sand for Rs 305 (later increased to Rs 410), while the market price was around Rs 2,200. In response to the irregularities, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), Nepal's anti-corruption agency, launched an investigation.</p><p>On January 23, 2015, the CIAA filed a formal corruption case at the Special Court against nine individuals. The charge sheet accused former PADT member secretaries Sushil Nahata and Nirmal Kuikel, along with three former Local Development Officers (LDOs) of Kathmandu—Mahendra Lal Shrestha, Gopal Prasad Parajuli, and Premraj Joshi—of being the principal figures who abused their authority. The contractors Bachchuram Dahal (of CN Construction), Miththram Dahal, and two PADT staffers, Bhisma Kumar Malla and Raj Kumar Regmi, were also named as defendants.</p><p>The CIAA's investigation concluded that the accused had colluded to misappropriate funds by:
<ul>
    <li>Awarding the sand mining contract without following a due legal process.</li>
    <li>Accepting a proposal to sell sand at excessively low rates.</li>
    <li>Allowing the contractor to excavate more sand than stipulated in the contract.</li>
    <li>Failing to conduct a required environmental impact assessment.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>On August 21, 2016, a bench at the Special Court delivered its verdict. It acquitted all seven public officials, stating that the charges brought against them by the CIAA lacked sufficient evidence. However, the court found the contractors guilty, fining Bachchuram Dahal Rs 144.5 million and Mitharam Dahal Rs 1.42 million.</p>

### General Context: Illegal Sand Mining in Nepal

Research indicates that illegal sand and aggregate mining is a widespread and persistent issue across Nepal, often involving collusion, violence, and significant revenue loss for the state.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Violence and Activism:</strong> The issue has led to violence. In a widely reported case from January 2020, a 24-year-old engineering student named Om Prakash 'Dilip' Mahato was murdered in Dhanusha for protesting illegal sand extraction from the Aurahi River.</li>
    <li><strong>Widespread Illegal Operations:</strong> Numerous reports highlight illegal mining activities across various districts like Rupandehi, Lalitpur, Dhading, Saptari, and Kathmandu, often performed without permits or in violation of environmental regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory Failures:</strong> Many crusher and mining industries operate without legal validity or renewed licenses. The government has faced criticism for failing to create a stable regulatory environment, which in turn fuels a black market where consumers are overcharged and the state is deprived of revenue.</li>
    <li><strong>CIAA's Role:</strong> The CIAA continues to be involved in investigating complaints and has issued broad suggestions to federal and provincial governments to better regulate the extraction of natural resources.</li>
