  "description": "<p>The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case against nine individuals, including former member secretaries of the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), former Local Development Officers (LDOs) of Kathmandu, and contractors. The case centered on the <strong>illegal awarding of a contract to excavate sand</strong> from 534 ropanis of PADT-owned land in Gothatar, Kathmandu, for a period of 18 months between 2008 and 2010.</p><p>The CIAA alleged that officials colluded to award the contract to CN Construction without following due process, at a rate significantly below market price, causing a loss of <strong>NPR 465.4 million</strong> to the state. According to reports, the PADT sold a truckload of sand for as low as NPR 305, while the market rate was around NPR 2,200.</p><p>Key allegations included:</p><ul><li>Awarding the sand mining contract without a proper legal process.</li><li>Accepting a proposal to sell sand at excessively low rates.</li><li>Allowing the contractor to excavate more sand than stipulated in the contract.</li><li>Failing to conduct a required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).</li></ul><p>On January 23, 2015, the CIAA filed the case at the Special Court. On August 21, 2016, a bench at the Special Court delivered its verdict. It <strong>acquitted all seven public officials</strong>, including former PADT member secretaries Sushil Nahata and Nirmal Kuikel, and former LDOs Mahendra Lal Shrestha, Gopal Prasad Parajuli, and Premraj Joshi, citing that the charges brought against them by the CIAA lacked sufficient evidence. However, the court found the contractors guilty, fining <strong>Bachchuram Dahal Rs 144.5 million</strong> and <strong>Mitharam Dahal Rs 1.42 million</strong>.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>A source mentioned that the CIAA was yet to investigate 14 additional corruption cases related to the PADT, suggesting that the misuse of funds at the organization could be more extensive than this single case.</p>",
