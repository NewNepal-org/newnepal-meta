### **Description of Allegations**
<p>The Karnali Provincial Government, led by then-Chief Minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi, has been accused of significant financial irregularities and corruption during the inauguration of the 'Karnali-Rara Tourism Year 2075'. The event was launched by then-Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli on April 14, 2018, at Rara Lake with the stated goal of attracting 500,000 tourists to the region.</p><p>Allegations of wrongdoing surfaced after starkly conflicting expenditure reports were presented by different government bodies. The initial budget approved by the cabinet was significantly lower than the final amount reported by the Office of the Auditor General. This discrepancy led to an investigation by the provincial Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which found that expenditures were made in violation of the Public Procurement Act, without proper cost estimation, and with a lack of supporting documents. The PAC concluded that over NPR 3.7 million was misappropriated and recommended action against those involved. Despite these findings, a formal corruption case by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has been pending for several years, leading to accusations that the investigation is being deliberately delayed to protect the officials involved.</p>

### **Financial Discrepancies**

<p>The core of the allegation lies in the wildly different figures for event expenditure presented by the government at different times:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Budget Approved:</strong> NPR 4.6 million (46 Lakh).</li>
    <li><strong>First Public Report (to Assembly):</strong> NPR 4.94 million (49.41 Lakh).</li>
    <li><strong>Report to PAC by Ministries:</strong> NPR 7.81 million (78.14 Lakh).</li>
    <li><strong>Auditor General's Report:</strong> NPR 8.71 million (87.18 Lakh).</li>
</ul>

<p>The PAC, in its findings, acknowledged the government's claim of NPR 49.41 lakh as a baseline but found the entire expenditure process to be against the law. The committee identified a clear corruption amount of <strong>NPR 3.77 million (37.77 Lakh)</strong>.</p>
