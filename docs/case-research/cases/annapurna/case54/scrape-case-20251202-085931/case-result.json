  "title": "Irregularities and Alleged Corruption in Karnali-Rara Tourism Year 2075 Inauguration",
  "description": "<p>The Karnali Provincial Government, led by then-Chief Minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi, is accused of significant financial irregularities during the inauguration of the 'Karnali-Rara Tourism Year 2075'. The event, launched by then-Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli on <strong>April 14, 2018</strong>, at Rara Lake, aimed to attract 500,000 tourists to the province.</p><p>The allegations center on starkly conflicting expenditure reports from various government bodies, which prompted an investigation by the provincial Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The financial discrepancies were significant:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial Cabinet Budget:</strong> NPR 4.6 million</li><li><strong>Reported to Provincial Assembly:</strong> NPR 4.94 million</li><li><strong>Submitted to PAC by Ministries:</strong> NPR 7.81 million</li><li><strong>Final figure in Auditor General's Report:</strong> NPR 8.71 million</li></ul><p>The PAC's investigation concluded that the expenditure was made in gross violation of the <strong>Public Procurement Act</strong>, without proper cost estimation, and lacked necessary supporting documents. The committee identified a misappropriated amount of <strong>NPR 3,777,000</strong> and recommended action against the involved ministers and officials. Further corroborating these irregularities, the Office of the Auditor General's annual report not only confirmed the highest expenditure figure but also noted that vouchers for NPR 902,877 were never submitted for audit.</p><p>Despite these findings and a formal complaint filed with the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the case has reportedly been stalled for several years, leading to accusations that the anti-graft body is deliberately delaying the investigation to protect high-profile political figures.</p>",
  "unverified_info": "<p>While the CIAA's Surkhet office has confirmed an ongoing investigation into the matter, the specific reasons for the multi-year delay are not officially clarified. An information officer cited the frequent changing of investigation officers as a potential cause. However, accusations persist that the delay is intentional to provide immunity to the high-profile individuals involved, including several then-ministers of the Karnali provincial government.</p><p>Specific details on how the allegedly misappropriated funds were spent by individual officials are not publicly available and are presumably part of the confidential CIAA investigation file.</p>",
