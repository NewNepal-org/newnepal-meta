## 1. Background Summary (TO VERIFY, CORRECT, AND EXPAND)

Treat the following as a **hypothesis**, not as established fact.

The user will provide some initial background text or notes about the case:

> [PASTE USER’S BACKGROUND / NOTES ABOUT THE CASE HERE]

Your first task is to **verify, correct, and enrich** this narrative using reliable, citable sources (official documents, reputable media, investigation reports, etc.).  
If something is wrong or incomplete, you must **explicitly correct it** in your final output.

---

## 2. Research Objectives

When you browse and analyze sources, focus on:

1. **Fact-checking & refining the narrative**
   - Confirm dates, money amounts, names, institutions, and key events.
   - Flag any conflicting accounts across sources and explain the discrepancies.

2. **Timeline reconstruction**
   - Build a chronological timeline from the earliest relevant event (e.g., policy decision, deal, incident, complaint) up to the latest verifiable development (e.g., verdict, ongoing investigation, political or administrative outcome).
   - Use specific dates wherever possible (YYYY-MM-DD).

3. **Actor & entity mapping**
   - Identify public officials, political figures, bureaucrats, institutions, companies, intermediaries, and other key actors.
   - For each: role, position at the time, and alleged or documented involvement.

4. **Legal, policy, and institutional framework**
   - Identify applicable laws, regulations, institutional rules, or codes of conduct.
   - Summarize how investigators, oversight bodies, or courts say they were breached (or why they concluded there was no breach).

5. **Financial, procedural, or power-structure analysis**
   - If relevant: procurement routes, contracts, pricing, cost overruns, unexplained benefits, or financial losses.
   - If not mainly financial: focus on abuse of power, conflict of interest, political capture, or institutional manipulation.
   - Explain how any “loss” or “wrongful gain” figures were calculated and by whom, if available.

6. **Accountability outcomes**
   - Who was accused, charged, investigated, or named?
   - Who was convicted, acquitted, sanctioned, or cleared?
   - Penalties: imprisonment, fines, compensation, bans, demotions, resignations, political consequences.
   - Note any appeals or pending legal/administrative steps, if available.

7. **Information gaps & controversies**
   - Identify key gaps, disputed facts, or open questions that remain unresolved.
   - Point out where primary documents would be needed for deeper verification.

## 3. Research Instructions

- **Actively browse the web** for:
  - Official documents (court decisions, commission reports, government records, audit reports, parliamentary committee reports, etc.)
  - Reputable news coverage and investigations
  - Policy or academic analysis (if available)

- **Source quality**
  - Prefer official and primary documents whenever possible.
  - Use reputable news outlets and recognized organizations for secondary coverage.
  - When sources disagree, describe the disagreement and indicate which seems more credible and why.

- **Citations format**
  - Use simple, human-readable citations like:
    - `[Outlet/Authority, Date, "Title", URL]`
  - Link directly to sources where possible.
  - Every important factual claim (dates, amounts, key decisions, quotes) should be traceable to at least one source.
