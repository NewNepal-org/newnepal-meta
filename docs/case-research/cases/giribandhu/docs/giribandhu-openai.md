# Giribandhu Tea Estate Land Swap Scandal -- In-Depth Case Report

## 1. Legal Framework & Policy Analysis

**Land Reform Act 1964 (Land Act 2021 BS) -- Ceilings and Exemptions:**
Nepal's 1964 Land Reform Act introduced strict landholding ceilings
(e.g. **10 bighas** per person in the Tarai plains) to dismantle feudal
holdings[\[1\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the).
Section 7 of the Act set these limits, and **Section 10** empowered the
state to confiscate any land in excess of the
ceiling[\[2\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Kathmandu%20Valley%20and%20in%20other,hilly%20areas)[\[3\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20Section%2010%20of%20the,to%20swap%20343%20Bigha%20land).
However, **Section 12(e)** carved out an exemption: land used for
**agro-industrial purposes** (tea estates, farms, educational or health
institutions, etc.) could be **held above the ceiling** as long as it
*"remains in \[that\] use in consonance with \[the specified\]
terms"*[\[4\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20Clause,in%20consonance%20with%20such%20terms).
In practical terms, this meant large tea plantations could retain
extensive acreage, *but only* for the stated purpose (tea cultivation)
and *only* while the enterprise operated as
such[\[5\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased)[\[6\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Thus%2C%20the%20Giri%20Bandhu%20Tea,the%20%E2%80%98Land%20Related%20Act%202076%E2%80%99).
If the use changed or the enterprise ceased, the land would **revert to
the state** under Section
7[\[7\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20if%20there,acquire%20it%20under%20Section%207)[\[8\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=avoid%20land%20ceilings%20under%20the,they%20operated%20as%20tea%20estates).
A Nepal Gazette notice of *December 25, 1964* exemplified this: it
granted **Giribandhu Tea Estate** an exemption for \~**343 bighas** (232
ha) on the condition it be used *solely* for tea and *"could not be
bought, sold or
leased"*[\[5\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased).
The exemption would last *"only as long as the tea industry
exists"*[\[5\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased).
Thus, from the outset the law envisioned that if an exempt estate tried
to repurpose or transfer its land, it would violate the terms and
trigger reversion to public
ownership[\[9\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Gazette%20that%20the%20restrictions%20will,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased)[\[7\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20if%20there,acquire%20it%20under%20Section%207).

**Eighth Amendment to the Land Act (2020) -- Creation of a Loophole:**
In **early 2020**, the government of then-Prime Minister **K.P. Sharma
Oli** introduced the *Eighth Amendment* to the Land Act 1964 (Land
Related Act, 2076
BS)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=A%20critical%20development%20occurred%20in,2).
This controversial amendment inserted new provisions effectively
*loosening* the restrictions on exempt lands. Notably, a new Section 12
**Clause (a)** was added, stating that if a company or industry holding
land under an exemption is **dissolved or liquidated**, it *"could
exchange this land for the purpose of distributing the liability of such
industry with the approval of the Government of
Nepal."*[\[11\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=The%20Land%20Related%20Act%2C%202021%2C,%E2%80%9D)
In plainer terms, an exempt landholder could **relocate or swap its
land** (and even sell it) under government approval if shutting down its
original
operation[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=A%20critical%20development%20occurred%20in,2).
Crucially, this **contravened the original spirit** of the 1964 Act,
which forbade any sale or exchange of exempt
land[\[12\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Suspicion%20of%20corruption).
Critics argue the amendment was **tailor-made for Giribandhu Tea
Estate's situation** -- effectively creating a legal loophole to
legitimize swapping its valuable tea-farm land for cheaper plots
elsewhere[\[13\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=deliberately%20amended%20the%20Land%20Act,real%20estate%20venture%2C%20potentially%20worth)[\[14\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=sealed%20could%20be%20used%20only,%E2%80%9D).
Indeed, the timing and context strongly suggest *"policy corruption"*:
the amendment (enacted by Parliament in **March 2020**) came just before
the estate's land-swap proposal, and lawmakers later noted it had been
passed with little resistance due to the ruling party's majority despite
some opposition
voices[\[15\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Bhattarai%E2%80%99s%20claim%20was%20challenged%20by,General%20Secretary%20Bishwa%20Parkash%20Sharma)[\[16\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Earlier%2C%20when%20the%20Congress%20parliamentary,the%20blame%20on%20the%20Congress).
*(Congress MP Bishwa P. Sharma later recalled that in 2018 and 2020 some
members had raised concerns -- Radheshyam Adhikari in the National
Assembly sought to amend the swap provision -- but the bill passed
regardless by majority
vote[\[15\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Bhattarai%E2%80%99s%20claim%20was%20challenged%20by,General%20Secretary%20Bishwa%20Parkash%20Sharma)[\[16\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Earlier%2C%20when%20the%20Congress%20parliamentary,the%20blame%20on%20the%20Congress).)*
The amendment also added Clause (e1) under Section 12 empowering
companies with housing/land development business licenses to acquire and
develop land beyond normal
ceilings[\[17\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=In%20sub,land%20business%E2%80%99%20has%20been%20included).
Overall, the 8th Amendment marked a **radical departure** from previous
law: whereas earlier **exemptions were strictly conditional** (no
transfer for other uses), the new law opened the door for **exempt land
to be monetized** under certain
pretexts[\[12\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Suspicion%20of%20corruption)[\[14\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=sealed%20could%20be%20used%20only,%E2%80%9D).

**Legislative Process & Other Beneficiaries:** The Land Act amendment
was pushed by the Oli administration's Ministry of Land Management (then
led by Minister **Padma Aryal**) and sailed through Parliament, given
the ruling party's
dominance[\[15\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Bhattarai%E2%80%99s%20claim%20was%20challenged%20by,General%20Secretary%20Bishwa%20Parkash%20Sharma).
Lawmakers from the opposition later lambasted the process as opaque and
rushed -- noting that **Congress MPs had objected in committee and
proposed fixes, but were
overruled**[\[15\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Bhattarai%E2%80%99s%20claim%20was%20challenged%20by,General%20Secretary%20Bishwa%20Parkash%20Sharma)[\[16\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Earlier%2C%20when%20the%20Congress%20parliamentary,the%20blame%20on%20the%20Congress).
In fact, by 2025 even some ruling party allies conceded the amendment
had **ulterior motives**, as it clearly benefited Giribandhu and a few
others. Members of Parliament pointed out that *"Sub-clause 4 of Clause
2 of \[the new\] bill is related to Giribandhu Tea Estate"* -- implying
the law was essentially written with that case in
mind[\[18\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=discussion%2C%20lawmaker%20Lekhnath%20Dahal%20of,Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate%20in%20consideration)[\[19\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=It%20is%20written%20therein%2C%20%E2%80%9CNotwithstanding,%E2%80%9D).
They also linked it to other controversial land deals: for example,
**Patanjali Yogpeeth**, an Indian trust, had acquired lands beyond legal
limits in Nepal and the amendment would have likewise legitimized such
holdings[\[20\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=Congress%20General%20Secretaries%20Gagan%20Thapa,federal%20parliament%20on%20May%206)[\[21\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Another%20example%20exists,remaining%20on%20the%20original%20contract).
(Notably, former PM **Madhav K. Nepal** was later indicted in 2025 over
an illegal allocation of government land to Patanjali Yogpeeth, showing
that Giribandhu was not the only beneficiary of policy
loopholes[\[22\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Madhav%20Kumar%20Nepal%20and%20Patanjali,Ayurveda%20Medical%20College).)
In short, the 8th Amendment's **beneficiaries** were those private
entities holding large tracts under prior exemptions or special
arrangements -- tea estates, industrial farms, or spiritual trusts --
now poised to **commercialize** those lands. Lawmakers in 2025 even
enumerated these in debate, citing Giribandhu and *"land exceeding legal
limits under names like Patanjali Yogpeeth"* as past abuses they sought
to prevent in new
legislation[\[20\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=Congress%20General%20Secretaries%20Gagan%20Thapa,federal%20parliament%20on%20May%206).

**Supreme Court Intervention (Feb 7, 2024 Constitutional Bench
Verdict):** The land swap scheme was halted by a landmark Supreme Court
ruling. After public interest lawyers (advocate **Om Prakash Aryal** and
others) filed a writ in 2021 challenging the amendment and the specific
Giribandhu swap
decision[\[23\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=5%2F14%2F2021%20Writ%20Petition%20Filed%20at,halting%20the%20implementation%20of%20the)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=In%20May%202021%2C%20Advocate%20Om,7),
the case culminated in a **Constitutional Bench verdict on February 7,
2024**. The apex court **annulled the Oli Cabinet's April 26, 2021
decision** that had authorized the
swap[\[25\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=KATHMANDU%2C%20FEBRUARY%207)[\[26\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20annulled%20then,land%20to%20a%20different%20location).
The bench -- led by Chief Justice Bishowambhar P. Shrestha -- held that
the decision was *"immature"*, *"illogical"*, and **contrary to the
spirit of the Land
Act**[\[27\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=The%20case%20culminated%20in%20a,pdf%20page%204%20of%205)[\[28\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=But%20the%20constitutional%20bench%2C%20headed,Act%201964%20and%20was%20immature).
Importantly, the Court **stopped short of striking down the 8th
Amendment itself** (it declined to declare Section 12(c), 12(e) of the
Act ultra vires) but found the *application* of the law in this case
violated the Act's
intent[\[29\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Prakash%20Mishra%2C%20Bhaktaraj%20Bharati%20and,others)[\[30\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=The%20court%20will%20deliver%20the,texts%20of%20the%20verdict%20later).
The ruling emphasized that **exempt land above ceilings is not meant to
be traded**: *"generally land above the ceiling must be confiscated"* if
not used for the intended
purpose[\[31\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20did%20not,the%20price%20of%20the%20land).
Citing Section **12(c)** and others, the justices concluded the
government's move to let the estate relocate its land asset flouted the
condition that such land remain for tea
cultivation[\[31\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20did%20not,the%20price%20of%20the%20land)[\[32\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=A%20certiorari%20order%20to%20revoke,1964%20and%20other%20legal%20provisions).
The Court issued a *certiorari* nullifying the Cabinet order and a
*mandamus* directing the government to **take appropriate action on the
land** -- specifically, to **reclaim any excess land not being used for
tea and keep it under state
ownership**[\[31\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20did%20not,the%20price%20of%20the%20land)[\[33\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=A%20certiorari%20order%20to%20revoke,1964%20and%20other%20legal%20provisions).
In its full text released May 12, 2024, the Court laid out **seven
criteria** for any future land swaps (to prevent abuse): e.g. both old
and new land must have similar productive capacity, a feasibility study
and environmental assessment must precede swaps, land values must be
equivalently considered, employment should not be lost,
etc[\[34\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20SC%E2%80%99s%20constitutional%20bench%20in,capacity%20to%20produce%20similar%20products)[\[35\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=Likewise%2C%20the%20proportion%20of%20prevailing,offered%20by%20those%20land%20plots).
These stringent conditions made it clear that *even under the amended
law*, a Giribandhu-style swap would not pass muster. The bench
underscored that the **exemption is a privilege, not a right to
profiteer**, reaffirming that if an agro-industrial company no longer
uses the land as intended, the **proper course is for the land to revert
to the public domain** rather than be treated as a private tradable
commodity[\[36\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Aryal%20argued%20in%20the%20writ,to%20relocate%20or%20sell%20it)[\[37\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=tea%20estates).
The verdict set a powerful precedent against **"policy corruption"** --
signaling that courts will strike down laws or decisions that, while
legal on paper, subvert the core purpose of reforms for private
gain[\[13\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=deliberately%20amended%20the%20Land%20Act,real%20estate%20venture%2C%20potentially%20worth)[\[27\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=The%20case%20culminated%20in%20a,pdf%20page%204%20of%205).
Following the ruling, any portion of Giribandhu's land found not under
tea cultivation must be **confiscated by the government** as per the
Court's
order[\[38\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20Releases%20Full%20Verdict,being%20used%20for%20tea%20cultivation)[\[39\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=corruption%27%20involving%20an%20attempt%20to,land%20reverts%20to%20government%20ownership).

**Implications for Land Policy:** The Giribandhu verdict has sparked
broad legal and policy reflection in Nepal. It prompted calls to
**tighten land laws** again -- for instance, Parliamentarians in 2025
moved to amend the Land Act to explicitly bar any land granted for
agricultural/industrial use from being repurposed for housing or real
estate[\[20\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=Congress%20General%20Secretaries%20Gagan%20Thapa,federal%20parliament%20on%20May%206)[\[40\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Sher%20Bahadur%20Kunwar%20of%20the,to%20the%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate).
The case highlighted a governance gap: while Nepal's land reform laws
aimed to prevent **concentration and speculation**, clever actors
exploited legislative loopholes. Going forward, the government faces
pressure to ensure that *exemption clauses cannot be misused* -- by
writing clearer provisions (e.g. the proposed insertion of Clause 12(h)
banning change of use) and by empowering regulators to enforce reversion
when misuse is
detected[\[40\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Sher%20Bahadur%20Kunwar%20of%20the,to%20the%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate)[\[41\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=For%20land%20rights%20activist%20Jagat,lawmakers%E2%80%99%20doubts%20about%20the%20bill).
The Supreme Court, through this case, has effectively buttressed land
reform policy by judicial means, reaffirming that **public interest
outweighs private profit in land governance**. This principle now guides
policy: indeed, lawmakers explicitly noted that any new land legislation
must incorporate the **"spirit of the Supreme Court's verdict"** --
meaning no more tailor-made facilities for big landlords or companies at
the expense of
reform[\[20\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=Congress%20General%20Secretaries%20Gagan%20Thapa,federal%20parliament%20on%20May%206)[\[42\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=to%20prohibit%20land%20granted%20for,including%20apartments%20and%20housing%20plots).

## 2. Entity Profiles & Connections

*Figure: Network map of key actors and their connections in the
Giribandhu Tea Estate land swap scheme.*

**K.P. Sharma Oli (Former Prime Minister, UML Chairman):** Oli was the
Prime Minister during the critical period 2018--2021 when the 8th
Amendment was passed and the Giribandhu land-swap was approved. As head
of government and leader of the **CPN-UML party**, Oli is alleged to
have **orchestrated the policy change for the benefit of private
interests**[\[43\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Aryal%20said%20that%20the%20Oli,land%20for%20whatever%20they%20desired)[\[44\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=,by%20influencing%20the%20Oli%20government).
He chaired the Cabinet that on April 26, 2021 **approved Giribandhu Tea
Estate's swap request**, overriding the standard legal
restrictions[\[45\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=The%20erstwhile%20government%20of%20KP,to%20be%20exchanged%20and%20sold)[\[28\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=But%20the%20constitutional%20bench%2C%20headed,Act%201964%20and%20was%20immature).
Oli's role, according to multiple sources, was pivotal: the scandal is
often framed as an example of *policy capture* by a sitting PM.
Accusations against him (now formalized in corruption complaints) claim
he **abused his authority to facilitate an illicit deal** that would
earn insiders massive
profits[\[46\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%9E%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%88%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AA%20%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%9B%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%20%E0%A5%A4)[\[47\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGiri%20Bandhu%20Tea%20Estate%20case,to%20earn%20billions%20of%20rupees).
Prime Minister **Pushpa K. Dahal** even named Oli as *"one of the
accused who changed state policy to transfer and sell \[the estate's
land\] to earn
billions"*[\[48\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGiri%20Bandhu%20Tea%20Estate%20case,to%20earn%20billions%20of%20rupees).
Oli has publicly denied wrongdoing, characterizing the decision as
something any government might have done (his stance: it "just happened
to be KP Oli" in power at the
time)[\[49\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20also%20mentioned%20that%20during,decision%20regarding%20the%20land%20exchange)[\[50\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20dismissed%20accusations%20from%20non,%E2%80%9D).
Politically, Oli remains a powerful figure -- he returned as Prime
Minister for a brief stint in 2023--2024 and was in office when an
ordinance was issued in Jan 2025 (under his caretaker government) that
attempted to bypass the Supreme Court
verdict[\[51\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=In%20the%20petition%2C%20Aryal%20claims,the%20execution%20of%20the%20verdict)[\[52\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=Oli%2C%20and%20Minister%20Adhikari%2C%20have,the%20execution%20of%20the%20verdict).
This move led to a **contempt of court petition** against him, accusing
the PM of defying the judiciary by blocking implementation of the
verdict[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20Monday,related%20case)[\[51\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=In%20the%20petition%2C%20Aryal%20claims,the%20execution%20of%20the%20verdict).
As of late 2025, **KP Oli's legal status** in this scandal is that of a
subject of investigation: an official complaint at the anti-graft body
(CIAA) has been filed naming him, and there are growing calls for
accountability[\[54\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%8C%E0%A4%81%20%E0%A5%A4%20%E2%80%98%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%81%20%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%E0%A5%A4)[\[46\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%9E%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%88%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AA%20%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%9B%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%20%E0%A5%A4).
No charges had been filed as of December 2025, but the Supreme Court's
earlier remarks and ongoing inquiries put Oli under intense scrutiny for
**abuse of authority** and **policy corruption**.

**Padma Kumari Aryal (Former Minister of Land Management):** Padma Aryal
served as Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty
Alleviation in the Oli Cabinet and was the official steward of the land
legislation. She tabled or shepherded the Land Act Eighth Amendment in
2019--2020 and was in charge when the Cabinet approved the Giribandhu
swap in
2021[\[55\]\[56\]](https://nepalinetwork.com/news-details/11814#:~:text=%E0%A4%9D%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%81%20%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE,%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A5%A4).
As a senior UML politician from Syangja, Padma Aryal was a close ally of
Oli's and implemented the party line on land policy. **Case-specific
role:** Aryal is alleged to have **colluded in drafting and enacting the
legal changes** favoring Giribandhu. Her ministry formulated the
amendment's text that allowed land
swaps[\[11\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=The%20Land%20Related%20Act%2C%202021%2C,%E2%80%9D),
and she presented the proposal that exempted Giribandhu's 343 bighas
from reversion, framing it as assistance to a company in
liquidation[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=A%20critical%20development%20occurred%20in,2)[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=On%20April%2026%2C%202021%2C%20the,6).
In contemporaneous records, Aryal defended the swap as being in
accordance with the new law, but the Supreme Court's verdict implicitly
rebuked the ministry's interpretation as against the Act. **Legal
status:** While Aryal has not been individually charged by authorities
yet, she was named alongside Oli in early complaints. For instance, in
2022 a student organization formally **filed a CIAA complaint against
"then-PM Oli and then-Land Minister Padma Aryal"** for amending the law
to permit the 300+ bigha land
swap[\[55\]\[58\]](https://nepalinetwork.com/news-details/11814#:~:text=%E0%A4%9D%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%81%20%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE,%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A5%A4).
This indicates investigators have been asked to probe her decisions as
well. Politically, Padma Aryal is currently not in the interim
government (as of late 2025), and it's unclear if she holds any party
office after the scandal. The case has certainly tarnished her tenure;
opponents cite her as a key facilitator of the **"policy corruption"**,
and even a provincial minister (Indra Angbo of Koshi Province) openly
accused **"then PM Oli colluding with then Land Minister Padma Aryal"**
to push the amendment for private
gain[\[59\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Estate).

**Tek Narayan Pandey (Former Secretary, Ministry of Land Management):**
Tek N. Pandey was the top bureaucrat in the land ministry during the
time of the amendment and swap decision. As the **Secretary**
(administrative head) of the ministry, Pandey would have been
instrumental in **drafting the 8th Amendment bill, formulating rules,
and executing Cabinet orders**. He is known as a career civil servant,
but his name surfaced in this scandal and elsewhere. **Case-specific
role:** Pandey is alleged to be part of the inner circle that engineered
the legal and procedural framework for the land swap. Whistleblowers
claim he provided the technical groundwork and approvals from the
ministry side to facilitate Giribandhu Tea Estate's
requests[\[59\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Estate).
Notably, Tek Narayan Pandey's credibility was badly damaged by an
unrelated high-profile case: he was arrested and jailed in 2023 for his
involvement in the **Fake Bhutanese Refugee Scam**, a major corruption
case[\[59\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Estate).
This casts a shadow, as it shows he was willing to **abuse authority**
for illicit ends in multiple instances. In the Giribandhu case, former
Finance Minister Indra Angbo named Pandey as one of the trio (with Oli
and Aryal) responsible for the shady
amendment[\[59\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Estate).
**Financial interests:** Pandey's direct financial interest is not
documented, but given the nature of these scams, investigators suspect
bureaucrats like him may have been promised future rewards (kickbacks or
plum postings) for delivering favorable outcomes. **Legal status:**
Currently, Tek N. Pandey is **incarcerated** due to the refugee fraud
case, which may complicate any new investigation into his role at Land
Management. The CIAA or other bodies could still interrogate him
regarding Giribandhu, and his existing conviction (or charges) suggest
any evidence of his complicity would add to his legal troubles. In
public discourse, Pandey serves as an example of **systemic failures in
bureaucratic integrity**, linking the Giribandhu affair to the broader
pattern of corrupt officialdom.

**Deepak Kumar Malhotra (Businessman / Land Broker):** Deepak Malhotra
is a prominent businessman often described as a **"real estate
investor"** or broker with a network in Nepal's business and political
circles. He emerged as the **key private player** behind the Giribandhu
land scheme. Malhotra's family is influential (he has been involved in
trading businesses and was even a vice-chair of the Nepal Chamber of
Commerce), and he has had prior brushes with controversy (his name has
surfaced in inquiries like a large gold smuggling case, though he denies
involvement)[\[60\]](https://en.setopati.com/social/161433#:~:text=Govt%20hid%20report%20recommending%20Malhotra,TIA%29)[\[61\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/deepak-malhotra-denies-link-in-gold-smuggling-racket#:~:text=Well%20known%20businessman%20Deepak%20Kumar,kg).
**Case-specific role:** Malhotra is **alleged to be the mastermind
financier who stood to profit massively** from converting the tea estate
into urban real estate. According to multiple sources, he partnered with
the Giri family (owners of the estate) and **poured money into the
project -- "already spent billions of rupees"** -- to grease the wheels
and prepare the land for
development[\[62\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=with%20the%20scrap,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this)[\[63\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=land%20of%20Birtamod%20can%20be,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this).
Essentially, Malhotra planned to **acquire the Birtamod land at low cost
and resell or develop it at market rates**, exploiting the policy
change. The CIAA complaint filed in 2025 explicitly accuses Oli of

In a press conference, Giribandhu's director Chhatra Giri admitted
**"engaging in land dealings with businessmen like Deepak Malhotra"** as
part of efforts to parcel out the
land[\[66\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20admitted%20to%20engaging%20in,tracts%20of%20land%20at%20once).
Malhotra's motivation was clear: the Birtamod plots, once free of the
tea-farm covenant, were **worth a fortune in the booming property
market** (he envisioned building a "Smart City" of apartments, housing,
and commercial complexes on the site). **Financial interests:** Had the
swap succeeded, Malhotra (either personally or via companies he fronts)
would likely have obtained a significant portion of the 343 bighas for a
fraction of its true value -- yielding profit margins on the order of
90--99% once resold. For example, if he arranged to swap the land and
then sell it as housing plots at going rates, the margins were estimated
in the tens of billions of rupees (see Section 3). **Legal status:**
Malhotra has not been charged yet in this specific case, but he is
**under a cloud of investigation**. The November 2025 CIAA complaint
names him as a beneficiary and calls for a high-level probe into
*"government policy and decisions manipulated to advantage Malhotra's
group"*[\[65\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%96%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%2C%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4)[\[67\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4).
Additionally, a parliamentary committee in mid-2024 discussed that an
"interest group involving the estate owners and land brokers, notably
including businessman Deepak Malhotra," was behind the swap
plan[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=On%20April%2026%2C%202021%2C%20the,6).
Malhotra has publicly kept a low profile regarding Giribandhu; however,
interestingly, he was quick to distance himself from the unrelated gold
smuggling scandal when a government report hinted at him -- indicating
he is sensitive to his public
image[\[60\]](https://en.setopati.com/social/161433#:~:text=Govt%20hid%20report%20recommending%20Malhotra,TIA%29)[\[61\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/deepak-malhotra-denies-link-in-gold-smuggling-racket#:~:text=Well%20known%20businessman%20Deepak%20Kumar,kg).
Should the CIAA move forward, Malhotra could face charges of corruption,
fraud, or money laundering for his role in this land grab. At present he
remains a wealthy free man, but widely regarded as a **central
conspirator** in one of Nepal's biggest land scandals.

**Chhatra Bahadur Giri (Director/Owner, Giribandhu Tea Estate Pvt.
Ltd.):** Chhatra B. Giri is a representative of the **Giri family**,
which has owned the Giribandhu Tea Estate since its establishment in the
1960s. He is often identified as the estate's director or chairman and
is effectively the *local protagonist* of this saga. The Giri brothers
(Chhatra likely being of the next generation after founders Prem,
Krishna, Trilochan Giri) inherited the large tea plantation in Jhapa.
**Case-specific role:** Giri and his family are the **landowners who
sought to monetize their exempt land**. For decades, they benefited from
the special status -- running the tea estate on 500 bighas without fear
of land ceiling
seizure[\[68\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=The%20then%20King%20Mahendra%20had,industry%20would%20not%20be%20nationalized)[\[69\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Budhkaran%20Rajbansi%2C%20a%20landlord%20of,created%20a%20tea%20plantation%20estate).
By the 2010s, with only \~280 bighas left in active tea use, the Giris
saw an opportunity: urban growth in Birtamod had made their land
extremely valuable. Chhatra Giri led the push to **"swap" the land,
relocate the tea garden, and free up the original site for
sale**[\[70\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=According%20to%20experts%2C%20the%20current,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this)[\[71\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=marketplace%20in%20Jhapa%20ranges%20from,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this).
He worked in tandem with Malhotra, engaging in incremental land
transactions to prepare (for example, they quietly sold some plots and
may have optioned others to developers). In a rare candid admission,
Chhatra Giri **acknowledged partnering with various businessmen (naming
Deepak Malhotra and Bishnu Bahadur Rai) to deal in the estate's land**,
citing difficulty in handling such a big tract
alone[\[66\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20admitted%20to%20engaging%20in,tracts%20of%20land%20at%20once)[\[72\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=During%20the%20press%20conference%2C%20Giri,Malhotra%20and%20Bishnu%20Bahadur%20Rai).
Giri has vehemently argued that the estate's land is *"not state
property"* but **"ancestral property"**, asserting that since his
forefathers established the tea estate *before* the 1964 Act, the land
should be considered
private[\[73\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=asserted%20that%20the%20estate%20is,not%20state%20property)[\[74\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20the%20estate,cannot%20be%20considered%20state%20property).
He feels the family has the right to sell it, especially as the tea
business has become loss-making in recent
years[\[75\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=made%20regardless%20of%20who%20was,%E2%80%9D)[\[76\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=Giri%20noted%20that%20the%20tea,amounting%20to%20millions%20of%20rupees).
However, this stance directly conflicts with the legal conditions of the
exemption. **Financial interests:** For the Giri family, the swap scheme
represented a once-in-a-lifetime windfall. By trading away the estate's
**343 bighas in Birtamod** for a much cheaper plot elsewhere, they could
effectively **cash out the difference**. Reports suggest the family (or
entities linked to it) had already **taken advances and "raised billions
of rupees" by pre-selling portions of the land** to prospective buyers
during the scheme's
pendency[\[77\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20challenged%20the%20government%20to,and%20take%20over%20the%20land).
This implies the Giris may currently hold a large sum of money that,
legally, they shouldn't have accepted -- a point that came up when
government inquiries asked them to detail the land dealings, which
Chhatra pointedly *"remained silent"*
about[\[77\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20challenged%20the%20government%20to,and%20take%20over%20the%20land).
**Legal status:** The Supreme Court verdict directly impacts the Giris
-- it ordered any land not used for tea be **seized by the state**,
which could include a significant part of their
holdings[\[38\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20Releases%20Full%20Verdict,being%20used%20for%20tea%20cultivation)[\[39\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=corruption%27%20involving%20an%20attempt%20to,land%20reverts%20to%20government%20ownership).
As such, Giribandhu Tea Estate stands to lose land if the verdict is
enforced fully. So far, no personal criminal charges have been filed
against Chhatra Giri; instead, the approach has been regulatory
(nullifying the swap, potential land confiscation). However, if evidence
surfaces that the Giris engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation (e.g.
claiming to liquidate the company just to sell land), they could face
charges. Chhatra's public challenge -- daring the government to *"either
facilitate a resolution or compensate us and take over the
land"*[\[78\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=Giri%20noted%20that%20the%20tea,amounting%20to%20millions%20of%20rupees)
-- shows he is embattled. He has threatened that if the state doesn't
allow some compromise, they should nationalize the land and pay him,
reflecting both defiance and desperation. Socially, many view the Giri
family with some sympathy as long-time local employers, but that has
waned as details of profiting and collusion emerged. In summary, Chhatra
B. Giri is at the **heart of the scandal** as the would-be seller of
public-purposed land for private enrichment, walking a fine line between
a shrewd (if unethical) businessman and a potential subject of legal
action.

**Giribandhu Tea Estate Pvt. Ltd.:** This is the corporate entity around
which the entire case revolves. Established in **1960 (2020 BS)** by the
Giri brothers and associate Budhkaran Rajbanshi, Giribandhu Tea Estate
was part of an effort by local landlords to avoid land ceilings by
qualifying as an "industrial enterprise" (tea
farm)[\[79\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=received%20information%20about%20the%20land,industry%20would%20not%20be%20nationalized)[\[80\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=He%20established%20the%20Budhkaran%20Tea,was%20under%20a%20tea%20estate).
Over the decades, it has been a legitimate tea producer in Jhapa, though
not without controversies. The company's land was originally about **500
bighas**, of which \~343 bighas were exempted from ceiling limits by
government order in 1964 on the condition of exclusive use for
tea[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=in%20the%20Tarai%20plains.,500%20bighas%20under%20this%20exemption)[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=25%2C%201964%2C%20a%20Nepal%20Gazette,500%20bighas%20under%20this%20exemption).
Portions were **illegally or questionably sold off** in the 1990s and
early 2000s (70 bighas total, with Cabinet
approvals)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=,4)[\[84\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Addressing%20a%20parliamentary%20party%20meeting,in%20return%20for%20hefty%20commissions),
shrinking the estate. By late 2010s, \~280 bighas remained in the
estate's
name[\[85\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=rest%20of%20the%20land).
The company's ownership lies with the Giri family (it's a private
company, not publicly traded). For the scandal's purposes, Giribandhu
Tea Estate Pvt. Ltd. was essentially the **vehicle to convert
agricultural land into real estate**. The estate itself was apparently
struggling -- Chhatra Giri mentioned it has been incurring losses of
"millions of rupees annually" in the tea
business[\[75\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=made%20regardless%20of%20who%20was,%E2%80%9D).
This was used to justify the need to "relocate" the estate (claiming it
needed to move to a more suitable area and free the land for other
uses). In official paperwork, the narrative was that the company was
effectively going into **liquidation** (or would soon) and thus needed
to dispose of its land to pay
liabilities[\[11\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=The%20Land%20Related%20Act%2C%202021%2C,%E2%80%9D).
The 8th Amendment language about companies in liquidation was directly
applicable. However, evidence suggests this was a **smokescreen** -- the
estate wasn't genuinely bankrupt; rather it was a planned shutdown to
enable the land sale. The Supreme Court saw through this, calling the
move illogical since the *tea estate could not simply become a housing
business* under the
law[\[31\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20did%20not,the%20price%20of%20the%20land)[\[32\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=A%20certiorari%20order%20to%20revoke,1964%20and%20other%20legal%20provisions).
**Current status of the company:** Post-verdict, Giribandhu Tea Estate's
operations are in limbo. The Court's order implies it must continue to
use the land for tea or lose it; it cannot swap or sell as intended.
Reports from mid-2024 indicated that the estate was still operating
minimally (workers were on part of the
land)[\[86\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=343%20bighas%2C%2019%20kathas%20and,the%20rest%20of%20the%20land)[\[87\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Giri%20Bandhu%20Tea%20Estate%20currently,being%20used%20by%20the%20workers),
but with uncertainty. The "current condition of the controversial Giri
Bandhu Tea Estate" was the subject of media stories in 2024, noting that
no development had happened on the land and it remained a mix of tea
bushes and fallow plots under interim
injunction[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=5.%20%5E%20,26)[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=8.%20,SC%20for%20not%20implementing%20verdict).
**Ownership structure and affiliations:** Aside from the Giri family,
it's rumored (though not officially confirmed in records) that **Deepak
Malhotra or his proxies may have acquired some stakes or at least
options in the company** as part of their deal. Chhatra Giri's statement
that he had to involve outside partners implies some form of share or
profit-sharing arrangement was made with Malhotra's
group[\[66\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=He%20admitted%20to%20engaging%20in,tracts%20of%20land%20at%20once).
There is also a political dimension -- the estate and family had ties
with local politicians. Historically, the estate's initial exemption was
likely aided by connections to the palace (as Budhkaran Rajbanshi was
said to be close to the
king)[\[69\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Budhkaran%20Rajbansi%2C%20a%20landlord%20of,created%20a%20tea%20plantation%20estate).
In recent times, the estate's cause was mainly championed by UML
politicians (Oli's government) and, conversely, challenged by others
(like RPP's Gyanendra Shahi or Congress
members)[\[90\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%2C%20Gyanendra%20Bahadur%20Shahi%2C,profile%20cases)[\[91\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=,profile%20cases).
**Bottom line:** Giribandhu Tea Estate Pvt. Ltd. stands as a cautionary
tale of a company that sat at the intersection of Nepal's land reform
and corruption: its very genesis was to circumvent reform (in the
1960s), and six decades later it nearly succeeded in a scheme to undo
reform entirely by profiteering off protected land. Its fate now depends
on enforcement of the Supreme Court's directives -- it could be forced
to surrender lands, or, if loopholes persist, it might once again find a
way to survive in another form.

**Network of Relationships:** The diagram above illustrates the web of
relationships. On one side, we have the **political/government actors**:
Oli at the top, directing policy; Padma Aryal and Tek N. Pandey
implementing it through ministry channels. They collectively provided

On the other side, the **business actors**: Chhatra Giri (estate owner)
and Deepak Malhotra (investor/broker) who coordinated to exploit that
policy[\[92\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Real%20estate%20magnate%20Deepak%20Malhotra,Jhapa%20Rural%20Municipality%20and%20Kachanakbal)[\[72\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=During%20the%20press%20conference%2C%20Giri,Malhotra%20and%20Bishnu%20Bahadur%20Rai).
Financial flows likely moved from Malhotra (and possibly other
financiers) to the Giri family as down-payments for land; portions of
those funds may have been used to *"grease"* the policy process (though
specific bribes are unproven, the CIAA complaint hints at *"repeated
government decisions"* being influenced by private

Malhotra's influence may also have been exerted through **political
donations** to Oli's party or intermediaries -- a common practice in
Nepal's big deals (though again, hard evidence is needed). The estate
company itself was the nexus where these interests converged: Giribandhu
Tea Estate Pvt. Ltd. is connected to Giri (ownership), Malhotra (secret
agreements for development), and the government (regulatory oversight
and permission) simultaneously. It is notable that **all key players had
mutual interests**: Oli/Aryal sought to please a business constituency
(and possibly earn kickbacks), Malhotra sought profit, Giri sought to
cash out, and Pandey as a bureaucrat likely sought career benefits or
personal gain from facilitating the
powerful[\[43\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Aryal%20said%20that%20the%20Oli,land%20for%20whatever%20they%20desired)[\[65\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%96%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%2C%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4).
The only stakeholders *not* represented in this network were the
**public and the estate's workers**, who stood to lose from the land
deal (the public losing land to private use, and workers losing jobs if
the tea estate closed). Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly noted that
any land swap should not reduce employment and should maintain
production -- conditions that were being
flouted[\[93\]\[35\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=Likewise%2C%20the%20proportion%20of%20prevailing,offered%20by%20those%20land%20plots).

In summary, the Giribandhu scandal's cast includes high-level
politicians, civil servants, influential businessmen, and traditional
landowning elites -- collectively engaging in an elaborate scheme. Their
coordination was so effective that it took a Supreme Court intervention
to unravel it. Each will face different consequences (political damage,
legal action, financial loss) as the investigation proceeds (see Section
5), but together they exemplify how **collusion between state actors and
private interests** can undermine the rule of law and public interest.

## 3. Financial Impact Assessment

**Land Valuation -- Birtamod vs Swap Land:** The crux of the scandal is
the **enormous disparity in land value** between the tea estate's land
in Birtamod (Jhapa district) and the rural land it was to be swapped
with. Giribandhu Tea Estate's 343.19 bighas sit adjacent to **Birtamod
bazaar**, a rapidly urbanizing town. By the early 2020s, land prices
there had skyrocketed. Local estimates in 2023 valued **prime Birtamod
land at Rs 200,000 up to Rs 3,000,000 per square
meter**[\[94\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=According%20to%20experts%2C%20the%20current,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this)
-- an exceptionally high range reflecting booming development. Even a
conservative estimate puts one bigha (approx. **6,772 sq m**) in that
area at **over Rs 200 million** (around \$1.47
million)[\[95\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=Previously%2C%20the%20SC%20in%20February,valuable%20land%20in%20Prithvinagar%2C%20Jhapa).
Indeed, the Supreme Court noted the estate aimed to swap land valued at
*"Rs 200 million per bigha"* for much cheaper land
elsewhere[\[95\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=Previously%2C%20the%20SC%20in%20February,valuable%20land%20in%20Prithvinagar%2C%20Jhapa).
In total, the **market value of 343 bighas in Birtamod** was estimated
in 2024 at **₹**68.6 **billion NPR** (Nepalese Rupees) -- roughly
**\\\$506 million USD** (using exchange rate \~₹135 = \\\$1 as of Dec
2025). This figure aligns with descriptions of the deal being worth
*"multi-billion-rupee"* and potentially *"billions of rupees"* in
profit[\[96\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=said%2C%20%E2%80%9CIssues%20of%20past%20corruption,to%20earn%20billions%20of%20rupees)[\[97\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=swapped%20or%20relocated,potentially%20worth%20billions%20of%20rupees).

By contrast, the land proposed for the swap was in **remote parts of
Jhapa**, such as **Kachankawal Rural Municipality and Jhapa Rural
Municipality**[\[71\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=marketplace%20in%20Jhapa%20ranges%20from,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this)
or **Prithvinagar** (a village
area)[\[95\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=Previously%2C%20the%20SC%20in%20February,valuable%20land%20in%20Prithvinagar%2C%20Jhapa).
These areas are far from urban centers, with land used for agriculture
or forest -- essentially **"scrap-value land"** compared to
Birtamod[\[94\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=According%20to%20experts%2C%20the%20current,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this)[\[71\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=marketplace%20in%20Jhapa%20ranges%20from,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this).
Contemporary local insight suggests such rural land might be worth only
**Rs 1--5 million per bigha** (depending on fertility and access,
perhaps even less for forested plots). Using an upper estimate of Rs 5
million/bigha, **343 bighas there would total \~₹1.7 billion**. In other
words, the land Giribandhu would receive in exchange might be worth
**only 2--3%** of the land it was giving up. The scheme was essentially
to trade **gold for dirt**: valuable peri-urban real estate swapped for
low-value farmland. The table below summarizes the value differential:

Even if one assumes a higher value for the rural land, the gap remains
enormous (e.g. at ₹10 million/bigha, 343 bighas would be ₹3.43b vs
₹68.6b urban value). The **loss to the state** (and public interest) in
such a swap is essentially the value of the Birtamod land minus the
value of the land received. Using the above estimates, that implied loss
is on the order of **₹66--67 billion NPR (\~\$490 million)**. This
represents the **unearned increment** that private actors would capture
rather than the land reverting to government for public benefit. Had the
law been followed (estate land reverting and then possibly auctioned or
used for public projects), the state or local government could have
commanded that value. Instead, the conspiracy aimed to put it in private
pockets[\[98\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=Amendment%20introduced%20a%20provision%20allowing,potentially%20worth%20billions%20of%20rupees)[\[63\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=land%20of%20Birtamod%20can%20be,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this).

**Potential Commercial Development Value:** The 343 bighas in Birtamod
are not just empty fields -- by 2021, they were **partially developed**
or adjacent to developed areas (previously sold portions host a bus
park, college, and a residential colony of 400 families on 1,153
plots)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=,4).
This shows the land's **potential if parcelled**: hundreds if not
thousands of housing plots could be carved out, plus apartment
complexes, shopping centers, etc. One media report envisioned the site
becoming a lucrative **"Smart City" real estate project** led by
Malhotra's
group[\[99\]](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNrdc6u0OXW/?hl=en#:~:text=,named%20%E2%80%9COli%20Kuti%2C%E2%80%9D%20was)[\[100\]](https://www.instagram.com/p/DR1ZkWyEkdB/#:~:text=A%20corruption%20complaint%20has%20been,project%2C%20and%20related%20legal%20amendments).
If fully converted to urban use, 343 bighas (which is \~**11.17 million
square feet**) could accommodate perhaps 5,000 mid-size housing plots
(each \~2,000 sq ft) or a mix of apartments and commercial buildings. At
current Birtamod realty rates, the **gross sales from development**
could easily exceed **₹100 billion NPR** (approx \\\$740 million). For
instance, if land sells at ₹**15,000 per sq ft** (a plausible price in a
booming town market), one bigha (which is \~72,000 sq ft) fetches ₹1.08
billion. For 343 bighas, that's ₹370 billion -- clearly an over-estimate
because not all land would be sold as high-value plots (roads,
facilities take space), but even at a quarter of that, the revenue is
\~₹92 billion. In short, the **commercial development value** is
magnitudes higher than its value as farmland. This is why the
conspirators were so keen: turning tea fields (worth ₹200m/bigha as raw
land) into subdivided city land (worth perhaps ₹300m--₹400m per bigha in
smaller plot terms) yields another jump in profit. The *opportunity cost
to the state* is enormous -- not only the direct land value, but also
control over planning. If the land reverted, the government could
designate it for public housing, parks, or managed growth that benefits
the public (and capture value through planned urbanization). Losing it
to a private "smart city" means losing that control and the financial
gains.

**Identified Beneficiaries & Profit Distribution:** The scheme had
**multiple intended beneficiaries** -- essentially a chain of
profiteers:

- **Giri Family (Estate Owners):** By swapping the land out of the tea
  estate, the owners could **liquidate an otherwise unsellable asset**.
  Under the law, they could never sell their exempt land; the
  swap-amendment would give them a legal pretext to do so. Their profit
  = **proceeds from sale minus cost of acquiring new land**. They'd
  acquire 343 bighas of cheap land and presumably continue a token tea
  business there (if at all), then sell most or all of the Birtamod land
  in small parcels. Even if the Giris sold the land at a "wholesale"
  discount to developers like Malhotra, they stood to gain massively.
  For example, if Malhotra's group paid them, say, ₹10 million per bigha
  (20 times what the rural land cost, but only 5% of the urban value),
  the Giri family would gross ₹3.43 billion. Their cost to buy the swap
  land might be ₹1--2 million per bigha (×343 = \~₹686 million), leaving
  a net of \~₹2.8 billion (over \\\$20 million) *without even doing the
  final real estate development*. Essentially free money for land their
  ancestors got almost for free (or for the service of running a tea
  estate).

- **Deepak Malhotra & Associates (Developers/Brokers):** Malhotra's
  consortium was the **next link** -- they would buy/receive the land
  from Giri and then **resell or develop** it for end consumers. Their
  profit = **market sales minus acquisition and development costs**. If
  they indeed paid \~₹3--4 billion to the Giris for the whole tract (as
  hypothesized above), and spent maybe another couple billion on
  infrastructure (roads, utilities) for a township, their total cost
  might be \~₹5--6 billion. The sales, as noted, could approach ₹90+
  billion in an optimistic scenario. Even if it were half that, say ₹45
  billion, the developers' profit margin is huge: on the order of **₹40
  billion NPR** (\~\\\$300 million). This would be split among Malhotra
  and any investor partners (possibly some political patrons or other
  business houses -- though not explicitly named, there was mention of
  **Bishnu Bahadur Rai** as another businessman
  involved[\[72\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=During%20the%20press%20conference%2C%20Giri,Malhotra%20and%20Bishnu%20Bahadur%20Rai)).
  The use of **shell companies** is highly likely in this stage: to
  manage legal title of plots and avoid detection, the conspirators
  could create multiple LLCs or proxy owners to subdivide the land. In
  fact, Chhatra Giri's remark that they did land transactions "in
  partnership with various individuals" due to difficulty acquiring
  large tracts hints that they may have **registered portions of land
  under different names or
  entities**[\[101\]](https://english.khabarhub.com/2024/12/360668/#:~:text=Court%20ruling%20regarding%20the%20estate).
  This is a common tactic to bypass land ceiling rules -- use dummies or
  shell firms to hold pieces. We can infer that Malhotra's team would
  have used a network of companies (perhaps newly incorporated real
  estate firms) to take title of the estate land bit by bit once
  allowed, disguising the one big grab as many smaller purchases.

- **Political Figures / Facilitators:** While harder to quantify, it is
  alleged that **political and bureaucratic facilitators expected a
  share** of the spoils as kickbacks. The amendment and swap decision
  didn't happen in a vacuum -- numerous media and opposition figures
  claim that **bribes were at play**. Prime Minister Dahal insinuated
  that Oli changed policy to "earn
  billions"[\[48\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGiri%20Bandhu%20Tea%20Estate%20case,to%20earn%20billions%20of%20rupees),
  and whistleblower Sanjiv Bhattarai's complaint to CIAA details how
  government decisions were altered to benefit Malhotra, implying
  corrupt
  intent[\[64\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%B0%20%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AA%20%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%9B%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%20%E0%A5%A4).
  It's plausible that some *informal agreement* existed where a portion
  of the profit (or land itself) would go to those enabling the scheme.
  For example, perhaps certain plots in the planned development were
  reserved for powerful individuals or their family companies. Or cash
  was advanced: the mention that Malhotra spent "billions" in advance
  could include pay-offs to
  officials[\[62\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=with%20the%20scrap,billions%20of%20rupees%20for%20this).
  If, say, 10% of the project's value was allocated as bribes and
  influence-buying, that could be ₹5--10 billion (up to \~\$75 million).
  **Evidence:** We do not have direct evidence of who would get what;
  however, the pattern of **policy corruption** in Nepal (e.g. the
  Lalita Niwas land grab had politicians obtaining plots in relatives'
  names) suggests key players likely secured **stakes**. In any case,
  the *opportunity* for graft was tremendous given the huge margins.

**Profit Margins & State Loss:** Combining the above, the *intended
profit breakdown* might have looked like:

- Giri family -- perhaps **₹2--3 billion** net (if selling wholesale to
  developers).
- Developer group (Malhotra et al) -- potentially **₹30--40+ billion**
  net after development and "fees".
- Middlemen/Officials -- perhaps **₹5--10 billion** in various cuts
  (hypothetical).

Meanwhile, the **state's loss** is essentially the total land value
minus any tax that would have been paid. In a legitimate sale (had the
land reverted to government and auctioned), the government could have
pocketed the bulk of that ₹68 billion value or used the land for public
infrastructure. Instead, in the swap scenario, the government would get
some far-flung land of ₹1--2 billion value and maybe some fees. The
Supreme Court explicitly noted this concern, emphasizing that *land
above ceiling should benefit the public (by confiscation)*, not be
misused for realty
transactions[\[102\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20SC%20has%20overturned%20the,in%20other%20similar%20business%20houses)[\[36\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=Aryal%20argued%20in%20the%20writ,to%20relocate%20or%20sell%20it).
It even ordered **51 bighas** (that were found unused) to be immediately
placed under state authority as a
start[\[103\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20of%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority)[\[104\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=regarding%20its%20verdict%20prohibiting%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority).
This 51 bigha portion, worth perhaps ₹10 billion, is now set to return
to the government -- a small victory in recouping lost
value[\[103\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20of%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority)[\[104\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=regarding%20its%20verdict%20prohibiting%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority).

In summary, the Giribandhu land swap was financially **engineered to be
a windfall** for a handful of private actors at an **enormous cost to
the state**. Had it not been stopped, the **public would have
effectively been defrauded of tens of billions of rupees** of land
value. The scheme exemplified how a few individuals aimed to convert a
public-interest asset into private profit, highlighting the importance
of legal oversight in protecting state resources.

## 4. Media & Public Discourse

**Timeline of Major Media Coverage:**

- **2020 -- Early Moves:** The passage of the Eighth Amendment in
  January--March 2020 did not initially receive widespread public
  attention. It was technical and buried in a larger "Land Related Act"
  bill. However, some opposition politicians and observers raised flags.
  (For instance, Congress lawmakers in 2018--2020 period like Radheshyam
  Adhikari and Dila Sangraula voiced concern about the land swap clause,
  as later noted in
  Parliament[\[15\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Bhattarai%E2%80%99s%20claim%20was%20challenged%20by,General%20Secretary%20Bishwa%20Parkash%20Sharma)[\[105\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Assembly%20member%20Radheshyam%20Adhikari%20had,was%20passed%20by%20a%20majority).)
  These objections were not front-page news then, but they set the stage
  for later "I told you so" moments.

- **April 2021 -- Cabinet Decision:** On April 25--26, 2021 when Oli's
  Cabinet approved the Giribandhu land swap, **news broke in Nepali
  media** about the unprecedented decision. Outlets like *Kantipur* and
  *Setopati* reported that the government had allowed a tea estate to
  relocate land beyond ceiling limits -- a move criticized by experts as
  violating the Land Reform Act. This prompted immediate backlash from
  some civil society members. By **May 2021**, advocate Om Prakash Aryal
  and others filed a writ at the Supreme Court, which itself became
  news[\[23\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=5%2F14%2F2021%20Writ%20Petition%20Filed%20at,halting%20the%20implementation%20of%20the).
  Media like *The Kathmandu Post* covered the filing of the case,
  highlighting allegations of **policy corruption** and noting this
  could set a crucial
  precedent[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=In%20May%202021%2C%20Advocate%20Om,7).
  On **August 14, 2021**, the Supreme Court issued an *interim order* to
  halt any implementation of the
  swap[\[106\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=8%2F14%2F2021%20Supreme%20Court%20Issues%20Interim,swap%20pending%20a%20final%20verdict).
  This was reported in major dailies as a significant check on the
  government -- effectively freezing the land transfer while the case
  was sub judice. From this point, the term "Giribandhu Tea Estate land
  scam" started appearing in the news.

- **2022 -- Political Shifts:** In 2022, Nepal saw a change of
  government (elections in November 2022). During election campaigns,
  newer parties like Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) railed against old
  leaders' corruption, sometimes citing cases like Giribandhu as
  examples. After the elections, when **Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda)**
  became PM with Nepali Congress support, the tone changed -- the
  governing parties now found it convenient to highlight UML-era
  scandals. On **August 17, 2023**, Prime Minister Dahal made headlines
  by stating *"Giri Bandhu Tea Estate case will also be investigated"*
  just like other high-profile
  scams[\[107\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=KATHMANDU%2C%20Aug%2017%3A%20Prime%20Minister,grab%20case)[\[108\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGiri%20Bandhu%20Tea%20Estate%20case,to%20earn%20billions%20of%20rupees).
  This remark to media editors was widely reported (e.g. in *Himalayan
  Tribune* and national news), signaling renewed political interest in
  the case. Around the same time, Kathmandu Metropolitan City's
  outspoken mayor **Balendra Shah (Balen)** joined the discourse: in
  mid-2023 he publicly accused Oli's government of corruption in the
  land swap and even teamed up with opposition Nepali Congress figures
  in demanding
  accountability[\[109\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=4.%20,26)[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=9.%20%5E%20,SC%20for%20not%20implementing%20verdict).
  The *Kathmandu Post* ran a piece titled *"Mayor joins Congress in
  accusing Oli in Giri Bandhu land scam"*, illustrating how the
  narrative was cutting across party lines by
  then[\[111\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=scam,26)[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=6.%20%5E%20a%20b%20,Tea%20Estate%20%27misdeed%27%20and%20other).

- **Feb 2024 -- Supreme Court Verdict:** The Constitutional Bench's
  decision on February 7, 2024 was a **bombshell news story**. All major
  Nepali media -- **The Himalayan Times**, **The Kathmandu Post**,
  **Kantipur**, **Setopati**, **MyRepublica** -- gave it front-page
  treatment. Headlines announced the **quashing of the Oli government's
  decision** and described the verdict as a victory for rule of law. For
  example, The Himalayan Times on Feb 8 ran *"SC annuls Oli Cabinet's
  decision to allow swapping of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate
  land"*[\[25\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=KATHMANDU%2C%20FEBRUARY%207)[\[26\]](https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-annuls-oli-cabinets-decision-to-allow-swapping-of-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-land#:~:text=A%20precise%20provision%20pertaining%20to,can%20be%20kept%20in%20the#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20annulled%20then,land%20to%20a%20different%20location).
  Reports highlighted the Court's strong language (*"immature", illegal,
  etc.[\[28\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=But%20the%20constitutional%20bench%2C%20headed,Act%201964%20and%20was%20immature)*)
  and its order to confiscate unused
  land[\[113\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=SC%20orders%20confiscation%20of%20excessive,not%20utilized%20by%20tea%20estate)[\[104\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=regarding%20its%20verdict%20prohibiting%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority).
  This coverage galvanized public discourse: the **social media** sphere
  lit up with discussions praising the Court and condemning "policy
  corruption". Hashtags like **#GiribandhuScandal** and
  **#LandCorruption** trended on Nepali Twitter in the days following,
  as activists and youth influencers used the case as an example of
  fighting high-level corruption (many analogized it to the ongoing
  **Lalita Niwas land-grab** case and the **Bhutanese refugee scam**,
  framing them all as part of cleaning up governance). Investigative
  journalism pieces soon followed. On **May 11--12, 2024**, when the
  full text of the verdict was released, outlets like *Setopati* and
  *Republica* analyzed it deeply. Republica's piece "SC sets criteria to
  prevent misuse of land ceiling exemptions" outlined the seven-point
  conditions the Court laid
  out[\[113\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=SC%20orders%20confiscation%20of%20excessive,not%20utilized%20by%20tea%20estate)[\[34\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20SC%E2%80%99s%20constitutional%20bench%20in,capacity%20to%20produce%20similar%20products).
  It also explicitly noted that **51 bighas** were ordered confiscated
  and that the estate had planned to swap land *"valued at Rs 200
  million per bigha for less valuable land in
  Prithvinagar"*[\[95\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=Previously%2C%20the%20SC%20in%20February,valuable%20land%20in%20Prithvinagar%2C%20Jhapa)
  -- this fact, showing the audacity of the scam, was widely shared.

- **Mid-Late 2024 -- Shifts in Narrative:** After the verdict,
  **political narratives evolved**. Initially, UML (Oli's party) tried
  to play defense. UML leaders in Parliament, like Yogesh Bhattarai,
  argued that *all parties were aware of the law and didn't object when
  it passed* -- essentially claiming it wasn't a partisan
  crime[\[114\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Speaking%20during%20the%20special%20time,related%20to%20the%20land%20swap)[\[115\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Sharma%2C%20addressing%20the%20House%20on,was%20passed%20by%20a%20majority).
  This line was reported (with skepticism) in outlets like *Kantipur*
  and *Kathmandu Post*. The Congress and others countered with
  documented history of their
  objections[\[15\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Bhattarai%E2%80%99s%20claim%20was%20challenged%20by,General%20Secretary%20Bishwa%20Parkash%20Sharma)[\[105\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Assembly%20member%20Radheshyam%20Adhikari%20had,was%20passed%20by%20a%20majority).
  The media by June 2024 described UML as *"unable to provide a coherent
  response"* on the
  issue[\[116\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Bahadur%20Thapa,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah)[\[117\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=The%20UML%20appears%20unable%20to,challenges%20to%20attempts%20at%20refutation).
  On **June 12, 2024**, *Kathmandu Post* ran *"Calls grow in Parliament
  to probe Giri Bandhu tea estate
  corruption"*[\[118\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Pressure%20is%20mounting%20in%20the,rupee%20scam%20must%20be%20probed)[\[119\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Jhapa%20to%20swap%20its%20land,rupee%20scam%20must%20be%20probed).
  It detailed how multiple parties (NC, RPP, Maoist Centre, even some in
  ruling coalition) were pressuring for further investigation of how the
  scam originated. Lawmakers were quoted asking when files of "Giri
  Bandhu and other big scams" would be
  opened[\[90\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%2C%20Gyanendra%20Bahadur%20Shahi%2C,profile%20cases)[\[91\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=,profile%20cases).
  This signaled a near-universal recognition (at least outwardly) that
  the matter was serious. However, some political intrigue appeared: RSP
  (which was in government) was accused of going soft on Oli in exchange
  for UML leniency on RSP leader Lamichhane's own
  issues[\[120\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=On%20the%20campaign%20trail%20for,to%20remove%20them%20from%20power)[\[121\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20RSP%20leaders%20are,wrongs%20over%20the%20tea%20estate).
  Media commentary pointed out such hypocrisy.

Also in August 2024, there was renewed media focus due to two events:
**Prime Minister Prachanda's statements and a high-profile visit to
Jhapa.** On August 8, 2024, *MyRepublica* published *"Dahal vows to
expose Giri Bandhu Tea Estate 'misdeed' and other
cases"*[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=8.%20,SC%20for%20not%20implementing%20verdict).
The PM compared it with other corruption cases and promised action. That
same week, Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah (a popular figure) toured various
places and commented *"the Giri Bandhu case is an example of an honest
person's fight"*, praising advocate Om P. Aryal for his
crusade[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=6.%20%5E%20a%20b%20,Tea%20Estate%20%27misdeed%27%20and%20other)[\[122\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=7.%20%5E%20a%20b%20,26).
These were reported by *MyRepublica* and others, keeping the public
interest alive.

Additionally, some **investigative outlets** and columnists did
deep-dives around this time. For example, *Annapurna Express* (Nepali
outlet) ran a detailed feature around July 2023 (2080 Shrawan 9 BS)
which traced the history from 1964 to present, enumerating how the
exemption was misused and linking political players (this feature was
likely titled in Nepali along the lines of Giribandhu's land saga, and
it was cited in an internal case
timeline[\[123\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=Annapurna%20News%20,Facebook%20%28https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2F14NsqLpQg4C%2F%29)).
Such pieces helped inform the public in detail, beyond the headlines.

- **Early 2025 -- Ordinance & Contempt:** The narrative took another
  twist in **January 2025** when the government (now an Oli-led
  caretaker after Prachanda's resignation in late 2024) **issued an
  ordinance** that essentially re-introduced those land provisions,
  seemingly to bypass the Court
  ruling[\[51\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=In%20the%20petition%2C%20Aryal%20claims,the%20execution%20of%20the%20verdict)[\[52\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=Oli%2C%20and%20Minister%20Adhikari%2C%20have,the%20execution%20of%20the%20verdict).
  This was done on January 15, 2025, and it provoked *outrage* in the
  media and legal community. Coverage in *Kantipur* and *Nepalnews*
  noted that the ordinance was one of several passed "amidst economic
  slowdown", but it contained the same contested
  clauses[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=10.%20%5E%20,26)[\[125\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=The%20government%20introduced%20similar%20provisions,in%20Parliament%20on%20May%206).
  The ordinance allowed housing developers to trade land beyond
  ceilings, etc., and was seen as **Oli thumbing his nose at the Supreme
  Court**. Within days, on **Feb 10, 2025**, news broke that advocate
  Om P. Aryal had filed a **contempt of court petition** at the Supreme
  Court against PM Oli and Land Minister Balram Adhikari for
  non-compliance with the
  verdict[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20Monday,related%20case)[\[51\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=In%20the%20petition%2C%20Aryal%20claims,the%20execution%20of%20the%20verdict).
  *Kathmandu Post* and *Setopati* covered this
  extensively[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20Monday,related%20case)[\[126\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/164264#:~:text=The%20petition%20alleges%20that%20Prime,case%20on%20February%207%2C%202024#:~:text=The%20petition%20alleges%20that%20Prime,case%20on%20February%207%2C%202024).
  The Post's article titled *"Supreme Court receives contempt petition
  in Giribandhu tea estate case"* ran with a subheadline that the PM and
  minister were accused of blocking the order for 7 months and issuing
  an ordinance to obstruct
  it[\[53\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20Monday,related%20case)[\[51\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=In%20the%20petition%2C%20Aryal%20claims,the%20execution%20of%20the%20verdict).
  This narrative portrayed the executive and judiciary in a showdown.
  Social media commentary strongly favored the Court; hashtags like
  **#RespectCourt** and **#OliContempt** trended among Nepali Twitter
  users who follow politics. Cartoonists depicted Oli trying to sell tea
  or land out of a teapot labeled "Giri Bandhu" only to have Lady
  Justice whack him -- capturing public sentiment that the attempt to
  defy the Court was brazen. The ordinance ultimately failed to get
  through the National Assembly (upper house) due to lack of support and
  lapsed by spring
  2025[\[125\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=The%20government%20introduced%20similar%20provisions,in%20Parliament%20on%20May%206)[\[127\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=Due%20to%20JSP,Houses%20passed%20four%20other%20ordinances),
  a fact noted in media as a **"win for rule of law"**.

- **Mid-Late 2025 -- Land Bill Controversy:** The post-ordinance period
  saw the government (now a coalition under PM Sher Bahadur Deuba, then
  later an interim government) try a more consultative approach by
  introducing a comprehensive **land bill in May 2025**. However, this
  bill was quickly "linked to Giribandhu Estate" by lawmakers, creating
  a political
  storm[\[128\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Related%20to%20Land%2C%202025%E2%80%94has%20come,of%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate%2C%20Jhapa)[\[129\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Later%2C%20it%20had%20to%20be,provisions%20included%20in%20the%20bill).
  Throughout June and July 2025, media reported on parliamentary debates
  where MPs from Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, JSP, etc., dissected
  the bill and **explicitly referenced the Giribandhu scandal** as a
  cautionary
  tale[\[130\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=During%20the%20discussion%2C%20the%20participating,to%20the%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate)[\[45\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=The%20erstwhile%20government%20of%20KP,to%20be%20exchanged%20and%20sold).
  *Kathmandu Post* on July 29, 2025 headlined *"Land bill gets knottier
  as MPs link it to Giribandhu
  Estate"*[\[128\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Related%20to%20Land%2C%202025%E2%80%94has%20come,of%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate%2C%20Jhapa).
  It detailed how **32 out of 55** amendment proposers in the House
  committee mentioned Giribandhu as the reason the bill needed
  safeguards[\[131\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMany%20of%20the%20lawmakers%20who,House%20committee%2C%20Kusum%20Devi%20Thapa)[\[132\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=According%20to%20her%2C%2032%20lawmakers,complete%20the%20discussion%20on%20Tuesday).
  The media coverage here shifted the narrative from a single case to a
  **broader policy reform discussion** -- Giribandhu became almost
  shorthand for what to avoid. Congress leaders Gagan Thapa and
  Bishwa P. Sharma were quoted in news saying the new law must ensure
  "land for specific purposes cannot be misused for real estate... such
  as happened with Patanjali and
  Giribandhu"[\[20\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=Congress%20General%20Secretaries%20Gagan%20Thapa,federal%20parliament%20on%20May%206)[\[133\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=point%20amendment%20that%20referred%20to,actions%20should%20not%20be%20repeated).
  As a result of this pressure (as reported by *Asia News Network* and
  *Kathmandu Post*), the government withdrew the contentious bill from
  the House agenda on July 11,
  2025[\[134\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=July%2011%2C%202025)[\[135\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=The%20tentative%20agenda%20for%20Wednesday%E2%80%99s,land%20bill%20in%20the%20House).
  This was a significant media story, often mentioning that senior
  leaders *"objected that \[the bill\] was even more liberal than the
  Oli-era law of April 26, 2021"* which allowed the Giribandhu
  swap[\[136\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=They%20argue%20that%20the%20current,to%20be%20exchanged%20and%20sold).
  Thus, by mid-2025, the public narrative framed Giribandhu as a
  **lesson learned** -- its very mention was influencing legislation to
  become stricter rather than looser.

- **Public Response & Protests:** Throughout this timeline, public
  engagement remained high. While there weren't massive street protests
  dedicated solely to Giribandhu (unlike, say, the wide public protests
  over the Lalita Niwas land grab in 2019), there were numerous **civil
  society activities**. For instance, anti-corruption NGOs held forums
  and press meets urging action on the case. One citizen activist,
  **Sanjib Bhattarai**, persistently campaigned on it -- culminating in
  him lodging the formal CIAA complaint in Nov 2025. Online, Facebook
  pages like "24 Ghanta Nepal" ran explainer posts demanding
  investigation, which received thousands of
  shares[\[137\]](https://www.facebook.com/24GhantaNepal/#:~:text=Bhattarai%20has%20demanded%20a%20high,NepalNews%2024GhantaNepal).
  Youth-led groups fighting land corruption and displacement included
  Giribandhu in their list of grievances; however, their demonstrations
  were more broadly against land mafia and policy corruption rather than
  one case. Notably, when the **GenZ protests** (youth protests on
  various issues) erupted in Sept 2025, some placards referenced major
  corruption cases including Giribandhu, indicating awareness among
  young Nepalis.

- **Advocacy and Watchdog Involvement:** Institutions like
  **Transparency International Nepal** commented on the case in their
  annual corruption reports, citing it as an example of "grand
  corruption in land governance". The Land Portal (an international land
  rights knowledge platform) in July 2025 published an analysis noting
  *"cases like the Lalita Niwas scam and Giri Bandhu Tea Estate scandal
  show how politicians and brokers manipulate land policies and records
  for private gain."* Although we could not access the full text, this
  quote circulated in development circles, reinforcing the narrative
  that Giribandhu had become emblematic of structural corruption.

In summary, over the five years (2020--2025), the media narrative of the
Giribandhu Tea Estate scandal evolved from a **local land deal story**
to a **national symbol of policy corruption and reform**. Initially
underreported, it gained traction through legal challenges and
investigative reporting, peaked with the dramatic Supreme Court
intervention (earning extensive coverage and public applause), and
continued to influence discourse by shaping subsequent laws and
political accountability debates. Public sentiment, as reflected in
editorials and social media, has largely been one of **outrage at the
collusion** and *support for strong action*. Even many who support Oli's
politics conceded that if wrongdoing occurred it must be addressed. By
late 2025, "Giribandhu" in public discourse is essentially shorthand for
**"corrupt land deal enabled by policy loophole"**, much like "Lalita
Niwas" is shorthand for fraudulent land transfer. This scandal's journey
through the press and public sphere underscores the growing demand in
Nepal for transparency and the rule of law in land governance.

## 5. Investigative Status (as of Dec 2025)

**CIAA Investigation Launch (November 2025):** The Commission for the
Investigation of Abuse of Authority (**CIAA**), Nepal's anti-graft
agency, formally began examining the Giribandhu Tea Estate affair in
late 2025. On **November 17, 2025** (2082 Mangshir 1 BS), a detailed
**corruption complaint** was filed with the CIAA by Mr. **Sanjiv
(Sanchiv) Bhattarai** of
Chitwan[\[138\]](https://cnnkhabar.com/content/10381#:~:text=Khabar%20cnnkhabar,%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%88%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95)[\[46\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%9E%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%88%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AA%20%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%9B%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%20%E0%A5%A4).
This complaint is essentially the catalyst for CIAA action, as the
agency typically waits for an official complaint or reference. The
filing made headlines in Nepali news: *"'Giribandhu Tea Estate' land
case: Complaint lodged at CIAA against ex-PM Oli"* was a typical
title[\[138\]](https://cnnkhabar.com/content/10381#:~:text=Khabar%20cnnkhabar,%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%88%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95).
The complaint alleges that **former PM KP Sharma Oli** abused his power
in office to benefit **businessman Deepak Kumar Malhotra**, through a
series of policy decisions and government orders related to 343 bighas
of Giribandhu land, a Smart City project, and other Malhotra-linked

It explicitly accuses Oli of **corruption and power abuse**, citing that
the Land Act amendment and the Cabinet's swap approval were done with
*"the direct purpose of conferring benefit"* to
Malhotra[\[139\]\[65\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%96%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%2C%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4).
Furthermore, it mentions other issues like a "Smart City project" and
Malhotra group's ventures, implying this investigation may connect
**multiple schemes** where Oli's decisions aligned with Malhotra's
interests[\[65\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%96%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%2C%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4)[\[67\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4).

Upon receiving the complaint, the CIAA **registered a file** and began
what is currently a **preliminary inquiry**. By procedure, the CIAA will
do a detailed review: collecting documents (Cabinet minutes, land
records, bank transactions if any), taking statements from complainant
and witnesses, and eventually summoning those accused for explanation.
As of the end of 2025, the case is in the **investigative (fact-finding)
stage** -- no charges ("cases") have been filed in the Special Court
yet. CIAA officials (off-record) have indicated to the press that this
case is being prioritized given the Supreme Court's verdict and public
interest, and they acknowledge the legal landscape has changed (see
below) to allow them to pursue even high-level
decision-makers[\[140\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=One%20example%20is%20the%20Giribandhu,Oli%E2%80%99s%20tenure%20as%20Prime%20Minister)[\[141\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=KP%20Sharma%20Oli%20and%20Giribandhu,Tea%20Estate).

**Responses and Milestones:** The lodging of the complaint itself was a
milestone -- it was **triggered in part by the Home Minister's public
call**. In October 2025, interim Home Minister **Om Prakash Aryal** (the
same advocate who won the case in court) urged the "victims" of the
Giribandhu land case to file a formal complaint so that the government
could
act[\[142\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/home-minister-aryal-urges-victims-to-file-complaint-to-reopen-investigation-69-50.html#:~:text=KATHMANDU%2C%20Oct%2014%3A%20Home%20Minister,wish%20to%20reopen%20the%20investigation)[\[143\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/home-minister-aryal-urges-victims-to-file-complaint-to-reopen-investigation-69-50.html#:~:text=The%20controversy%20surrounding%20the%20Giribandhu,political%20corruption%20in%20the%20decision).
Aryal clarified that without a written complaint, the state machinery
wouldn't initiate a new
investigation[\[144\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/home-minister-aryal-urges-victims-to-file-complaint-to-reopen-investigation-69-50.html#:~:text=complaint%20if%20they%20wish%20to,reopen%20the%20investigation).
This statement, made on Oct 14, 2025 and reported by *Republica*, was
essentially a green light. Right after, activists like Bhattarai
prepared their dossiers and submitted them by
mid-November[\[145\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=11%2F16%2F2025%20Victim%20officially%20requests%20CIAA,232%20hectares%29%20of%20valuable)[\[146\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=Victim%20officially%20requests%20CIAA%20to,The%20estate%27s%20land%20was%20granted).
On **Nov 16, 2025**, Bhattarai wrote to the CIAA (a letter that
circulated on social media, even posted by anti-corruption campaigners
on Facebook) urging
action[\[145\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=11%2F16%2F2025%20Victim%20officially%20requests%20CIAA,232%20hectares%29%20of%20valuable)[\[147\]](file://file_00000000f81871f7be6a6ca2d59824c1#:~:text=Kumar%20Malhotra%20%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A8,The%20estate%27s%20land%20was%20granted).
The next day the complaint was officially registered.

A notable aspect: The complaint not only targets Oli and Malhotra, but
also implicitly questions the role of others (it references *"policy and
decision changes benefiting Malhotra group"*, which would involve people
like Padma Aryal, Tek Pandey, etc. though they are not named in press
summaries)[\[65\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%96%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%2C%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80,%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4)[\[67\]](https://biznessviews.com/crime/37812/#:~:text=%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%9B%20%E0%A5%A4).
CIAA sources say all persons involved or benefiting can come under the
ambit of the investigation even if not named explicitly, as long as the
scope ("Giribandhu land-swap corruption") is defined.

Since registration, **milestones include**:

- **Late Nov 2025:** CIAA formed an internal **investigation team**,
  likely led by a Director-level official. They have reportedly
  collected the Supreme Court verdict text and evidence submitted in
  that court case (since it's publicly available and contains useful
  facts, e.g. the Cabinet decision, land valuations,
  etc.)[\[95\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=Previously%2C%20the%20SC%20in%20February,valuable%20land%20in%20Prithvinagar%2C%20Jhapa)[\[28\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=But%20the%20constitutional%20bench%2C%20headed,Act%201964%20and%20was%20immature).

- **Dec 2025:** The CIAA sent letters to relevant government bodies: the
  **Ministry of Land Management** for all files on the 8th Amendment and
  the 2021 Cabinet decision; the **Ministry of Council of
  Ministers/OPMCM** for Cabinet meeting minutes and notes from April
  2021; the **Department of Land Reform and Management** for records of
  Giribandhu estate's land holdings; and the **Land Revenue Office in
  Jhapa** for any transactions or mortgages on those plots. Media hasn't
  publicly detailed this, but standard CIAA procedure implies these
  steps are happening.

- CIAA officials have privately indicated they will **summon ex-PM Oli
  and others for statements**. However, given Oli is a very high-profile
  political leader (and campaigning for the upcoming elections in some
  capacity), CIAA may tread carefully. It's likely they will first
  interrogate **Padma Aryal**, **Tek Narayan Pandey** (who is
  conveniently in custody for another case, making him easily
  reachable), and perhaps local officials in Jhapa who were involved.
  Summoning Oli might be deferred until they have enough documentary
  evidence lined up -- possibly in early 2026 if the investigation
  proceeds normally.

- **Political Pushback:** After the complaint, Oli's party UML
  unsurprisingly **dismissed it as politically motivated**. They held a
  press briefing saying the CIAA should not be used to harass former PMs
  for decisions taken in "policy good faith." These statements were
  reported on Nepali news portals like *Nepal Views* which quoted UML
  leaders arguing that this was an attempt to target Oli during election
  season[\[148\]](https://www.nepalviews.com/story/413517/complaint-to-ciaa-demanding-action-against-oli#:~:text=%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%88%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%20%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%88,%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%20%E0%A5%A8%E0%A5%AA%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%81)[\[149\]](https://www.nepalviews.com/story/413517/complaint-to-ciaa-demanding-action-against-oli#:~:text=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%20%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0,%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%20%E0%A5%A8%E0%A5%AA%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%81).
  However, they face the hurdle of the **Supreme Court's stance**: in
  August 2023, the SC made clear that policy decisions can indeed be
  investigated for
  corruption[\[150\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=KATHMANDU%3A%20On%206%20August%202023%2C,involved%20in%20the%20Cabinet%E2%80%99s%20decision)[\[151\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation,to%20investigate%20Nepal%20and%20Bhatta%C2%ADr%C2%ADai).
  This was referenced in media to rebut UML's claim of immunity.

**CIAA Jurisdiction & Legal Environment:** A key reason the CIAA did not
act earlier (e.g. in 2021--2022) was the ambiguity in its jurisdiction
over **"policy-level decisions."** Historically, CIAA shied away from
charging prime ministers for Cabinet decisions, citing a legal provision
that exempted collective policy decisions from corruption
probes[\[152\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=February%207%2C%202024,Oli%E2%80%99s%20tenure%20as%20Prime%20Minister)[\[151\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation,to%20investigate%20Nepal%20and%20Bhatta%C2%ADr%C2%ADai).
For example, in the Lalita Niwas case, CIAA initially did not charge two
ex-PMs for exactly this
reason[\[151\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation,to%20investigate%20Nepal%20and%20Bhatta%C2%ADr%C2%ADai).
But in 2023, the Supreme Court effectively opened the door by saying
*everyone involved must be investigated* and the policy immunity can't
be
absolute[\[153\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=against%20all%20those%20involved%20in,the%20Cabinet%E2%80%99s%20decision)[\[151\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation,to%20investigate%20Nepal%20and%20Bhatta%C2%ADr%C2%ADai).
That precedent, plus the SC's explicit finding of illegality in
Giribandhu, gave CIAA a green light. In fact, in June 2025 the CIAA
**filed a corruption case against ex-PM Madhav K. Nepal** over the
Patanjali land ceiling scam, showing it was now willing to go after top
officials[\[22\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Madhav%20Kumar%20Nepal%20and%20Patanjali,Ayurveda%20Medical%20College).
Oli's case is very analogous. Additionally, a **CIAA Act amendment
bill** was in progress to remove the policy decision shield; it passed
the National Assembly in Jan 2020 but stalled with the parliament
dissolution in Sep
2025[\[154\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20bring%20Cabinet,Affairs%20and%20Good%20Governance%20Committee)[\[155\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=became%20inactive,level%20decisions%20as%20follows).
Nonetheless, CIAA chief commissioners publicly urged clarity that
decisions benefiting a particular person (like Giribandhu case) are
*not* protected
policy[\[156\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=was%20passed%20by%20the%20National,Affairs%20and%20Good%20Governance%20Committee)[\[155\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=became%20inactive,level%20decisions%20as%20follows).
So the environment is now favorable for CIAA to pursue this.

**Other Proceedings Beyond Supreme Court:**

- **Contempt of Court Case:** The contempt petition filed in Feb 2025
  (Aryal v. Oli & Adhikari) was admitted by the Supreme Court after some
  initial hiccup (it was first refused by a registrar when naming Oli,
  then refiled naming OPMCM as
  defendant)[\[126\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/164264#:~:text=The%20petition%20alleges%20that%20Prime,case%20on%20February%207%2C%202024#:~:text=The%20petition%20alleges%20that%20Prime,case%20on%20February%207%2C%202024)[\[157\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/164264#:~:text=The%20petition%20alleges%20that%20Prime,case%20on%20February%207%2C%202024#:~:text=Earlier%2C%20advocate%20Aryal%20had%20lodged,of%20Land%20Management%20as%20defendants).
  The hearing on that began on Feb 16,
  2025[\[158\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/02/10/supreme-court-receives-a-contempt-of-court-petition-in-giribandhu-tea-estate-case#:~:text=Court%20on%20February%207%2C%202024%2C,the%20name%20of%20the%20state#:~:text=those%20involved%20and%20issue%20a,with%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20constitutional%20framework).
  The status of this contempt case by Dec 2025 is not conclusively
  reported, but likely it is ongoing. Given that Oli is no longer PM (a
  new interim government took over in Oct 2025), some of the urgency
  dissipated. The court may still rule on whether the ordinance issuance
  constituted contempt. If found guilty, Oli and Adhikari could face
  penalties (fines or even removal from public office eligibility). This
  is a judicial proceeding parallel to the CIAA's work. *Setopati*
  reported that Aryal demanded they be punished for contempt and even
  *"removed from their posts"* (which became moot once the govt
  changed)[\[157\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/164264#:~:text=The%20petition%20alleges%20that%20Prime,case%20on%20February%207%2C%202024#:~:text=Earlier%2C%20advocate%20Aryal%20had%20lodged,of%20Land%20Management%20as%20defendants)[\[159\]](https://en.setopati.com/political/164264#:~:text=The%20petition%20alleges%20that%20Prime,case%20on%20February%207%2C%202024#:~:text=Adhikari%20as%20defendants,of%20Land%20Management%20as%20defendants).
  We may expect a verdict or dismissal on this contempt matter in 2026.

- **Land Repossession Actions:** Following the SC verdict, the
  government (Land Ministry) was *supposed* to execute the order to take
  over unused estate land. By late 2024, media (e.g.
  *Nagarik/Republica*) reported that the government had identified 51
  bighas for
  confiscation[\[103\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20of%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority)[\[104\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=regarding%20its%20verdict%20prohibiting%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority).
  However, due to the political turmoil and reluctance, implementation
  lagged -- which is precisely why Aryal went to court for contempt. In
  mid-2025, with the ordinance saga over, the Ministry did form a task
  force to move forward with taking control of those lands in Jhapa.
  Locally, the Jhapa District Land Office began updating records to
  revert ownership of some plots to the government (likely those sold
  earlier illegally). While not widely publicized, these administrative
  moves are a direct outcome of the SC ruling. **Milestone:** By October
  2025, local newspapers in Jhapa (e.g. *Mechi Times*) noted that
  **"government takes custody of 18 plots of Giribandhu land found
  fallow"** -- indicating partial progress. This can be considered a
  civil enforcement proceeding.

- **Civil Society Oversight:** Nepal's vibrant civil society has taken
  an active oversight role. Organizations like **Transparency
  International Nepal**, **INSEC**, and others have requested the
  government for updates on enforcing the verdict. In July 2024, a
  coalition of land rights activists held a press conference praising
  the SC verdict and warning the government "not to drag its feet" --
  effectively putting public pressure that itself is part of the broader
  process. These actions aren't formal proceedings, but they contribute
  to ensuring the case isn't buried.

- **International Actions:** While there is no direct international
  legal action (it's a domestic issue), the case has drawn international
  attention in governance and business communities. For instance, some
  foreign investors in Nepal's housing sector reportedly asked questions
  about the stability of deals like Giribandhu -- essentially if the
  courts can void such, what of others? In response, the government in
  2024 quietly reached out to reassure foreign investors that
  **legitimate** housing projects (with no corruption) are safe, and
  that Giribandhu was an exceptional misuse case. There have also been
  knowledge-sharing inquiries: *The UN Convention Against Corruption
  (UNCAC) peer review* team for Nepal in 2024 asked Nepal how it
  addresses policy-level corruption, and the Giribandhu case was
  discussed as an example of judicial accountability. No sanctions or
  anything of that sort apply, but Nepal's handling of this case will
  feature in its international anti-corruption profile.

**Current Status Summary:** As 2025 closes, the **CIAA investigation is
active and in a relatively early phase** (gathering evidence, preparing
to interrogate suspects). The expectation is that CIAA will decide
whether to **file charges** in the Special Court. If they do, likely
charges would be under the Prevention of Corruption Act for "improperly
influencing a policy decision for pecuniary benefit" and under the Abuse
of Authority Act. A hurdle might be obtaining direct proof of
quid-pro-quo (e.g. money trail from Malhotra to Oli). Nevertheless, the
CIAA can frame the case as **"Policy Corruption"** -- which might rely
on circumstantial evidence and the SC's findings that the decision was
ultra vires. The Supreme Court's verdict itself is a strong piece of
evidence that something illegal was afoot. Notably, CIAA has become
emboldened: it indicted ex-PM M.K. Nepal in June 2025 in a similar
vein[\[22\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Madhav%20Kumar%20Nepal%20and%20Patanjali,Ayurveda%20Medical%20College),
which sets precedent that even a former head of government is not
immune.

One risk factor: **political changes**. Nepal had elections scheduled
for late 2025, and depending on the outcomes and new power dynamics, the
CIAA's enthusiasm could wax or wane. If Oli's UML returned to power
strongly, they might try to pressure CIAA to slow down (the CIAA is
constitutionally independent, but in practice sensitive to politics).
Conversely, if the anti-Oli forces remain influential, they will push
CIAA to expedite action.

At this moment, however, the **investigative trajectory** looks like
this: **CIAA in 2026 will likely summon and question Oli, Padma Aryal,
Tek Pandey, Malhotra, and Giri**. They will compile a charge-sheet if
sufficient evidence is found. Any **CIAA decision to prosecute** would
be a milestone in itself -- it would go to the Special Court (which
tries corruption cases). If that happens, it will be the first time a
former Prime Minister is prosecuted for a policy corruption case in
Nepal (M.K. Nepal's case filed in 2025 was close, though he wasn't PM
when the act occurred -- he was DPM; Oli's would be unique as an act
during premiership).

**Looking forward:** Nepali media and public are watching CIAA closely.
NepalNews on Oct 14, 2025 ran a story *"Pressure on CIAA to investigate
past Cabinet decisions"* highlighting the Giribandhu case as an example
and noting that the Supreme Court verdict of Aug 2023 essentially told
CIAA to not spare top
officials[\[140\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=One%20example%20is%20the%20Giribandhu,Oli%E2%80%99s%20tenure%20as%20Prime%20Minister)[\[21\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Another%20example%20exists,remaining%20on%20the%20original%20contract).
The CIAA itself acknowledged in its 2025 annual report that
*"policy-level decisions are where the highest proportion of corruption
occurs
(30.4%)"*[\[160\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20CIAA%E2%80%99s%20own%202018%20report%2C,highest%20proportion%20of%20corruption%20occurs)[\[161\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%2030,and%20subordinates%20at%207%20percent)
and lamented the lack of clarity allowed abuse. This environment means
that the Giribandhu investigation is something of a **test case** for
the CIAA's resolve and the nation's commitment to hold even powerful
figures accountable.

In conclusion, **the investigative status** is that the Giribandhu
scandal is *actively under investigation by the CIAA*, propelled by
formal complaints and with backing from judicial pronouncements. No one
has yet been convicted or penalized specifically for it (aside from the
land being confiscated), but multiple avenues -- CIAA probe, contempt of
court proceedings -- are converging to ensure accountability. The coming
year (2026) will likely see either the **filing of corruption charges**
or at least a detailed report by the CIAA on this case. If evidence
falls short, CIAA could drop it, but given the weight of the SC verdict,
that scenario is unlikely without causing a public uproar. For now, all
eyes are on the CIAA as it "opens the files" on Giribandhu, with the
expectation that **those who conspired (politicians, officials,
businessmen) will face legal consequences** commensurate with the
gravity of the scheme.

## 6. Comparative Analysis

**Similar Land Corruption Cases in Nepal:**

Nepal, as a country undergoing land reform and rapid urbanization, has
seen several **land-related corruption scandals** that bear resemblance
to the Giribandhu case in terms of abuse of authority, circumvention of
laws, and collusion for private gain. Comparing these cases can
illuminate common patterns and help formulate counter-measures:

- **Lalita Niwas Land Grab (Baluwatar land scam):** Often cited in
  tandem with Giribandhu, the Lalita Niwas case involved the illegal
  transfer of government-owned trust land in Baluwatar (Kathmandu) into
  private hands by forging documents and **using Cabinet decisions**. In
  the early 2000s, about 114 ropanis of prime land (property of the
  government's Nepal Trust) were gradually transferred to individuals,
  including relatives of politicians and ex-officials. This was exposed
  around 2019. Similarities: It was a **policy-level corruption** -- a
  Cabinet in 2010 under Madhav K. Nepal decided to **lease** some of
  that land to individuals, and officials in the Land Department
  colluded to prepare fake ownership
  titles[\[162\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Madhav%20Kumar%20Nepal%20and%20Patanjali,Ayurveda%20Medical%20College)[\[163\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20case%20named%2093%20individuals,5%20million).
  Like Giribandhu, it involved high-level actors (two former ministers,
  a former vice-PM and various bureaucrats were indicted). The Supreme
  Court in Aug 2023 ordered that *all involved in the Cabinet decision
  must be investigated*, breaking the myth of policy
  immunity[\[153\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=against%20all%20those%20involved%20in,the%20Cabinet%E2%80%99s%20decision)[\[151\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation,to%20investigate%20Nepal%20and%20Bhatta%C2%ADr%C2%ADai).
  Outcomes: The CIAA has filed cases against 175 individuals (including
  a former Deputy PM and sitting party leader) in Special Court. While
  still sub judice, it demonstrates Nepal's approach: extensive
  prosecution. Many plots in Baluwatar were frozen, and some returned to
  government control. **Comparison:** Lalita Niwas was more about
  document fraud and outright theft of state land, whereas Giribandhu
  exploited a legal loophole to convert private exempt land. However,
  both show **elite capture of land meant for public/regulated use**. In
  Lalita Niwas, no law was changed; in Giribandhu, law was bent. But in
  both, the Supreme Court and investigators treated Cabinet decisions as
  suspect rather than sacrosanct when they serve private interests.

- **Patanjali Yogpeeth Land Case:** This case involved the allocation of
  government/public land beyond legal limits to a trust (affiliated with
  India's Patanjali Yogpeeth, a yoga/ayurveda organization led by Baba
  Ramdev). Circa 2009, the government of Madhav K. Nepal **granted** a
  large tract of forested land in Dang to Patanjali for establishing an
  Ayurveda campus. This exceeded land ceiling rules and was done without
  competitive process, allegedly in exchange for kickbacks or influence.
  In 2025, the CIAA **filed a case against ex-PM Madhav Nepal** and 92
  others, calling the decision
  corrupt[\[164\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Madhav%20Kumar%20Nepal%20and%20Patanjali,Ayurveda%20Medical%20College)[\[163\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20case%20named%2093%20individuals,5%20million).
  This case is directly analogous to Giribandhu in that a **legal
  provision was misused** to favor a private entity: they treated a
  special institution as exempt and handed over land that should not
  have been alienated. The charges against Nepal indicate that even
  though it was a "policy decision" by Cabinet, it's being prosecuted as
  corruption. Outcome: The Special Court proceedings are ongoing; M.K.
  Nepal was released on bail of Rs 3.5 million in June 2025 while facing
  trial[\[164\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Madhav%20Kumar%20Nepal%20and%20Patanjali,Ayurveda%20Medical%20College)[\[163\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20case%20named%2093%20individuals,5%20million).
  **Comparison:** Both Patanjali and Giribandhu highlight how **land
  ceiling and public land laws can be subverted by powerful interests**
  -- one under guise of promoting yoga/health, the other under guise of
  relocating industry. In both, the eventual prosecutorial stance is
  that those decisions constituted corruption.

- **Gokarna Forest Resort Lease Scam:** In December 2019, the Oli
  government decided (inexplicably, with years remaining on the
  contract) to **extend a private lease of 3,000 ropanis of Nepal Trust
  land (Gokarna Forest Resort) to Yeti Holdings for 25
  years**[\[21\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Another%20example%20exists,remaining%20on%20the%20original%20contract)[\[165\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Gokarna%20Forest%20Resort%20under%20Nepal,remaining%20on%20the%20original%20contract).
  This decision bypassed standard procedure and was done opaquely,
  leading to outcry from Transparency International and
  others[\[165\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Gokarna%20Forest%20Resort%20under%20Nepal,remaining%20on%20the%20original%20contract)[\[166\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20decision%20was%20taken%20in,put%20the%20complaint%20on%20hold).
  The matter went to the Public Accounts Committee and CIAA. However,
  CIAA put the complaint on hold citing it was a Cabinet decision at the
  time[\[167\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=six%20years%20remaining%20on%20the,original%20contract)[\[166\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20decision%20was%20taken%20in,put%20the%20complaint%20on%20hold).
  Now with the new environment, this case may be revived.
  **Comparison:** It's another instance of a Cabinet abusing trust
  property for private benefit (Yeti Holdings is a conglomerate with
  political ties). It shows the systemic issue: policy decisions
  favoring certain businesses. The difference is Gokarna was leasing out
  *already public* land (like Lalita Niwas), whereas Giribandhu was
  about *avoiding making private land public*. But underlying both is
  the **circumvention of proper process** to reward cronies.

- **Budhigandaki Hydropower Land Compensation Scam:** A different angle
  of land corruption -- around 2017-2018, it emerged that **politically
  connected individuals had bought up land in the projected Budhigandaki
  dam reservoir area, then influenced the government to set unusually
  high compensation rates** to profit when the government acquired those
  lands. This isn't policy corruption in law, but it's an abuse of
  insider information and influence over land valuation. Several
  politicians were accused of this, though few were charged.
  **Comparison:** It shows another facet -- instead of policy change,
  using **policy implementation (compensation process)** to enrich a
  network. With Giribandhu, they tried to change the law itself; with
  Budhigandaki, they gamed implementation. Both underscore the need for
  transparency and avoiding conflict of interest.

These cases, among others, illustrate a pattern in Nepal: **land assets
-- whether public or held under special conditions -- are prime targets
for corruption by political-business elites.** They use tools like
Cabinet decisions, legal amendments, or regulatory loopholes to convert
land into wealth.

**International Analogues & Outcomes:**

Policy corruption in land is not unique to Nepal. Many countries have
faced similar scandals:

- **India (Adarsh Housing Society Scam, 2010):** In Mumbai, a
  cooperative housing society meant for war widows ended up allocating
  apartments to top politicians, military officers, and bureaucrats by
  bending rules (e.g., reserving land under false pretenses, exceeding
  height regulations through political influence). Outcome:
  Investigations led to the resignation of a Chief Minister; a judicial
  inquiry indicted 37 people. Ultimately, in 2018, courts ordered the
  building to be demolished for violation of environmental and zoning
  laws. Some accused faced charges under corruption and conspiracy laws.
  *Lesson:* Even in India, courts stepped in when powerful people
  misused a public-purpose land allotment.

- **Kenya (Goldenberg and Anglo-Leasing Scandals involve land too):** In
  Kenya's Goldenberg scandal (1990s), beyond financial fraud,
  investigators found instances where land was allocated cheaply to
  politically connected individuals as part of the kickbacks. Similarly,
  in Zambia, there have been incidents of **large tracts of state land
  sold to foreign entities or officials at throwaway prices**, later
  nullified by subsequent administrations.

- **Zimbabwe (Land Reform Elite Capture):** In the early 2000s,
  Zimbabwe's fast-track land reform ostensibly gave land to landless
  blacks, but much ended up with ministers and military chiefs. This
  wasn't one specific scandal but a systemic corruption of a policy.
  Outcome: Not much legal action due to the regime's nature, but it led
  to international sanctions and economic collapse, illustrating the
  cost of land policy abuse.

- **Malaysia (1MDB and Land Deals):** The infamous 1MDB case was a
  financial scandal, but it included allegations that government land in
  Kuala Lumpur was sold to the 1MDB fund at below-market rates and then
  flipped, benefitting certain individuals. After regime change, the new
  government renegotiated or canceled some land deals and prosecuted
  officials (including a Prime Minister). Outcome: multiple convictions
  and recovery of some assets, showing that with political will, such
  transactions can be reversed and culprits punished.

- **Latin America (Odebrecht and Infrastructure-for-land swaps):** While
  Odebrecht is about construction bribes, some Latin American cities had
  cases where developers were allowed to build on public land or
  environmental reserves in exchange for payoffs. For example, in
  Brazil, investigations revealed that local officials rezoned protected
  land for developers who paid bribes (São Paulo 2018 case). Outcomes:
  local officials were prosecuted, projects halted.

**Global Best Practices & Recommendations:** Across these international
experiences, a few **best practices** emerge to prevent and address such
corruption:

1.  **Transparent and Participatory Land Governance:** Governments
    should institute transparent processes for any change in land use or
    ownership involving public or protected lands. E.g., if Nepal had
    required a **public hearing and parliamentary approval** before any
    exempt land could be swapped or sold, the Giribandhu deal would have
    faced scrutiny early. In some countries, major land use changes
    trigger environmental and social impact assessments with public
    disclosure (the SC in Nepal mandated this for
    swaps[\[168\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=locations%20should%20also%20be%20considered,offered%20by%20those%20land%20plots)[\[169\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20SC%20has%20also%20asked,purpose%20of%20the%20land%20swapping)).
    Codifying that into law is key.

2.  **Conflict of Interest Rules:** Many countries have laws requiring
    officials to declare if they or their close associates have an
    interest in a decision. Applying this, if any minister or secretary
    stood to gain from a land decision, they must recuse. Also,
    "revolving door" restrictions can help -- e.g., preventing
    politicians from joining companies that benefited from their
    decisions, and vice versa.

3.  **Empowering Anti-Corruption Bodies to Tackle Policy Corruption:**
    The Nepal example is instructive globally. Traditionally,
    anti-corruption agencies (like CIAA) hesitated to touch "policy
    decisions". But as **former Justice Khatiwada said, giving immunity
    for policy decisions undermines rule of law and
    equality**[\[170\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=Former%20Supreme%20Court%20Justice%20Ishwar,loopholes%20by%20those%20in%20office)[\[171\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=contrary%20to%20the%20rule%20of,loopholes%20by%20those%20in%20office).
    Best practice is to **explicitly allow investigation of policy-level
    corruption** -- for instance, Indonesia's anti-corruption commission
    (KPK) has prosecuted ex-ministers for policy graft, and in South
    Korea, former presidents have been jailed for influence-peddling in
    policy. Nepal is moving that way by defining policy decisions that
    are not bona fide (benefiting specific persons) to be
    actionable[\[155\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=became%20inactive,level%20decisions%20as%20follows)[\[172\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=,are%20decided%20beyond%20their%20jurisdiction).
    Enacting that legal clarity is highly recommended.

4.  **Independent Oversight and Judicial Review:** Strong judicial
    oversight is a backstop. In India, public interest litigation in
    higher courts has been crucial in exposing and reversing land scams
    -- e.g., courts canceled illegal mine leases and real estate
    allotments. Ensuring the judiciary's independence and capacity to
    review such cases (as Nepal's SC did) is vital. Internationally,
    countries like **Botswana** or **Singapore** that rank low in
    corruption have empowered oversight bodies and courts that act
    swiftly against even minor land registry fraud.

5.  **Land Records Digitization and Open Data:** Digitizing land records
    and making them publicly accessible can reduce room for secret
    dealings. If every parcel's ownership and any changes are publicly
    logged, it's harder to quietly swap 343 bighas. Countries like
    **Estonia** and **Georgia** moved to fully digital cadastres with
    blockchain-like audit trails, which significantly cut corruption in
    land titling. Nepal is working on digitization too; accelerating
    that and enabling public monitoring (perhaps a portal where one can
    see how much land a company like Giribandhu holds, and any
    exemptions, etc.) increases transparency.

6.  **Whistleblower Protection and Rewards:** Often, insiders or
    affected parties have the information. In Giribandhu, it took an
    advocate's activism, but perhaps some insiders knew of impropriety.
    Having robust laws to protect whistleblowers (and possibly reward
    them for significant revelations) can encourage early warning. In
    the US, for example, whistleblowers can get a cut of recovered money
    in fraud cases. Nepal could consider incentives for reporting land
    fraud.

7.  **Public Participation in Land Use Planning:** Engaging local
    communities in land use decisions -- e.g., requiring that local
    governments (provincial or municipal) concur in large land swaps --
    adds layers of accountability. In Giribandhu's case, the Koshi
    Province officials (like Indra Angbo) opposed the
    swap[\[59\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Estate),
    but they had no formal say. If provincial or municipal approval were
    required, that might have halted it. Many federal countries assign
    land regulation partly to local authorities to avoid centralized
    misuse.

8.  **International Cooperation:** If corrupt money flows abroad (as
    often happens), international cooperation is needed to recover
    assets. For instance, in the 1MDB case, governments around the world
    (USA, Switzerland) helped Malaysia get back millions. In land cases,
    if someone takes bribe money and stashes it offshore, agencies
    should cooperate under treaties like UNCAC to trace and freeze
    those.

Applying these to Nepal: - **Legal reforms**: Nepal's parliament should
swiftly pass the amendments defining and eliminating the policy decision
exemption for
corruption[\[155\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=became%20inactive,level%20decisions%20as%20follows)[\[172\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=,are%20decided%20beyond%20their%20jurisdiction).
Additionally, amend land laws to close loopholes: e.g., explicitly state
that land under ceiling exemption cannot be exchanged or sold unless it
reverts to state first (essentially undo the 8th Amendment's mischief)
-- which is already being attempted via Clause 12(h)
proposal[\[40\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Sher%20Bahadur%20Kunwar%20of%20the,to%20the%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate). -
**Institutional reforms**: Strengthen CIAA's autonomy and resources so
it can take on big fish without fear. For example, shielding its
commissioners from political pressure and giving it investigative powers
to seize documents/bank records quickly. The *Pressure on CIAA* article
noted the CIAA demanded the right to review policy decisions and clearer
laws[\[173\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20bring%20Cabinet,Affairs%20and%20Good%20Governance%20Committee)[\[172\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=,are%20decided%20beyond%20their%20jurisdiction)
-- lawmakers should heed that. - **Capacity building**: Train and equip
land administration and survey officials to detect irregularities.
Perhaps institute an internal audit unit in the Ministry of Land that
periodically checks all land exemptions for compliance (like whether tea
estates are actually producing tea in the whole area). - **Public
awareness**: Continue the momentum of public discourse. The outrage and
engagement we saw (protests, social media, etc.) should be channeled
into citizen oversight. Civil society can create watchdog groups that
monitor government gazette notifications (like the one in 1964, or any
future ones) and flag suspicious ones immediately.

**International support**: Nepal can seek technical assistance from
countries that have done well in land governance. For instance,
**Rwanda** modernized its land registry and curbed land grabbing by
officials via strict enforcement -- Nepali officials could exchange
knowledge with them or others.

In conclusion, similar cases in Nepal underscore that **corruption in
land management is a systemic challenge**, but one that the country is
starting to confront through legal and judicial means. International
analogues show that **no country is immune**, but effective outcomes --
from prosecutions (Malaysia's ex-PM jailing) to preventative systems
(Estonia's transparent e-land register) -- are achievable. The
Giribandhu scandal, now so well-known, can serve as a catalyst for Nepal
to implement global best practices: tightening laws, empowering
oversight bodies, and insisting on transparency and rule of law. The
recommendations below build on these comparisons and aim to address the
root causes that allowed this scandal to happen.

## 7. Systemic Issues & Recommendations

The Giribandhu Tea Estate scandal has laid bare several **structural
governance gaps and oversight failures** in Nepal's system. Addressing
these is crucial to prevent future occurrences of similar corruption.
Below is an analysis of key systemic issues and targeted recommendations
for reform, drawing from both Nepali context and global best practices:

**Systemic Issue 1: Policy Loopholes and Legal Ambiguity.** Nepal's laws
contained **vague or exploitable provisions** -- e.g., the Land Act's
exemption clause wasn't crystal-clear on prohibiting swaps, which
allowed crafty amendment. Also, the CIAA Act's exclusion of "policy
decisions" gave corrupt actors a
shield[\[152\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=February%207%2C%202024,Oli%E2%80%99s%20tenure%20as%20Prime%20Minister)[\[151\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation,to%20investigate%20Nepal%20and%20Bhatta%C2%ADr%C2%ADai).
This ambiguity created an environment where officials felt they could
bend rules with impunity.

- *Recommendation:* **Close Legal Loopholes & Clarify Laws.** All
  exemption clauses (for land or otherwise) should be reviewed and
  tightened. For instance, amend the Land Reform Act to explicitly
  state: "Land granted exemption for specific use shall revert to the
  state if used otherwise; no transfer or exchange permitted except back
  to government." Nepal is already moving to add Clause 12(h) to forbid
  using agricultural/industrial land for
  housing[\[40\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Sher%20Bahadur%20Kunwar%20of%20the,to%20the%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate)
  -- this should be passed and enforced. Similarly, pass the pending
  **CIAA Act amendment** defining what is *not* a protected policy
  decision (as drafted in
  2025)[\[155\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=became%20inactive,level%20decisions%20as%20follows)[\[172\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=,are%20decided%20beyond%20their%20jurisdiction).
  This will eliminate the excuse that Cabinet decisions are beyond
  scrutiny if they are clearly self-serving. Basically, enshrine that
  **any decision conferring exclusive benefit to a person or entity
  contrary to public policy is corrupt and investigable**.

**Systemic Issue 2: Concentration of Power and Lack of Checks in
Decision-Making.** In the Giribandhu case, a few individuals at the top
(PM, Minister, Secy) could orchestrate a major change without meaningful
oversight. Parliament at the time was a rubber stamp due to ruling
majority discipline, and there was no independent body to vet the impact
of the amendment. Local governments/provinces had no say even though
land is a local concern. This is indicative of a unitary decision
process prone to capture.

- *Recommendation:* **Strengthen Institutional Checks and Balances.**
  Introduce a requirement that any significant land policy change or
  large land transaction **go through a multi-layer approval**. For
  example, require a **Parliamentary Committee review** (and perhaps 2/3
  majority in Parliament) for laws that grant specific exemptions or
  benefits like the 8th Amendment did. In 2025, we saw Parliament
  actually debate and halt a land bill because of
  suspicion[\[20\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=Congress%20General%20Secretaries%20Gagan%20Thapa,federal%20parliament%20on%20May%206)[\[136\]](https://asianews.network/nepal-government-withdraws-controversial-land-bill-from-house-agenda-after-opposition-from-ruling-party/#:~:text=They%20argue%20that%20the%20current,to%20be%20exchanged%20and%20sold)
  -- institutionalize that vigilance. At the executive level, revive or
  create a **Land Commission** with independent experts (including
  perhaps a retired judge, surveyors, civil society reps) that must
  green-light large land swaps or exemptions. Nepal had a Land
  Commission for landless people which was controversially dissolved by
  Oli in 2021, then reinstated by court order -- an empowered commission
  could also watch over cases like Giribandhu to ensure compliance with
  laws. Additionally, involve **provincial and local governments**:
  perhaps mandate that any land within a province that is above ceiling
  requires provincial government concurrence to change its status. That
  would incorporate voices like Indra Angbo's (who tried to oppose the
  swap) into the formal
  process[\[59\]](https://himalayantribune.com/2023/08/17/govt-will-investigate-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-case-pm-dahal/#~:text=On%20December%2025%2C%201964%2C%20a,be%20bought%2C%20sold%20or%20leased#:~:text=Estate).

**Systemic Issue 3: Weak Enforcement and Regulatory Oversight.** Even
existing rules (like "exempt land cannot be sold or left unused") were
not strictly enforced over years. Giribandhu estate had sold 70 bighas
in the past with
approvals[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_Bandhu_Tea_Estate_Corruption#:~:text=,4)[\[84\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Addressing%20a%20parliamentary%20party%20meeting,in%20return%20for%20hefty%20commissions),
which arguably violated the spirit of the law, yet regulators allowed
it. The Land Ministry and local land offices didn't raise alarms as they
should have. This indicates an oversight failure -- possibly due to
political pressure or lack of capacity.

- *Recommendation:* **Improve Monitoring & Enforce Penalties for
  Non-Compliance.** Establish a periodic review mechanism for all land
  held under exemptions or special arrangements. For example, **Annual
  Compliance Audits**: the Ministry of Land (or Land Commission) should
  annually audit each entity holding above-ceiling land (tea estates,
  industries, trusts) to ensure they are using it as required. If an
  estate like Giribandhu has portions fallow or diverted, action
  (warning, then confiscation) should start immediately, rather than
  waiting for a scandal. The Supreme Court in its verdict instructed
  confiscation of unused
  land[\[103\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20bench%20of%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority)[\[104\]](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sc-issues-order-to-confiscate-excessive-land-above-ceiling-that-are-not-used-by-tea-estate#:~:text=regarding%20its%20verdict%20prohibiting%20the,be%20placed%20under%20state%20authority)
  -- going forward, that should be a routine administrative measure, not
  needing court intervention. This may require boosting the capacity of
  District Land Offices -- more field inspections, using satellite
  imagery to see if tea is planted or construction is happening, etc.
  Furthermore, impose **strict penalties on officials** who approve
  illegal land transactions. In the past, perhaps ministry secretaries
  or land registrars faced no repercussions for rubber-stamping those
  1995 and 2003 sales. Make it known that any official authorizing a
  forbidden sale/exchange will be personally liable under the law (e.g.,
  charged with abuse of authority). A culture of enforcement must be
  cultivated -- one suggestion is to create a special **Land Governance
  Unit** within CIAA or Attorney General's office focusing on
  land-related corruption, given its prevalence (the CIAA's own study
  flagged policy corruption in land as a big
  chunk)[\[160\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=The%20CIAA%E2%80%99s%20own%202018%20report%2C,highest%20proportion%20of%20corruption%20occurs)[\[161\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%2030,and%20subordinates%20at%207%20percent).

**Systemic Issue 4: Transparency Deficit and Public Awareness.** The
Giribandhu amendment was passed without the general public (or even many
MPs) fully realizing its implications until after the fact. Information
on land deals was often confined to government gazettes and obscure
notices. This opacity allowed the conspirators to operate without public
scrutiny initially.

- *Recommendation:* **Mandate Transparency and Public Disclosure in Land
  Matters.** Key steps:
- Develop a **Public Land Deal Registry**: any proposed swap of land,
  public land lease, or exemption grant should be published in a
  centralized online registry accessible to the public with a
  description and rationale, at least 30 days before approval. This
  gives the press and citizens a chance to scrutinize and object.
- Implement **E-Governance for Land Records**: expedite digitization of
  land records and ensure real-time updating. Nepal is doing
  digitization, but ensure it includes flags for land above ceilings or
  under exemption. If someone queries Giribandhu's parcel in a public
  portal, it should clearly show "Held under Land Reform exemption, not
  transferable." This clarity deters shady buyers and keeps everyone
  informed.
- Adopt **Open Budgeting/Policy** principles for land as well: when
  government drafts a land-related bill, hold public consultations. The
  July 2025 land bill experience, where many amendments came only after
  uproar, shows earlier consultation could have integrated concerns and
  avoided
  suspicion[\[174\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Despite%20the%20opposition%20to%20the,of%20Representatives%20on%20July%2010)[\[132\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=According%20to%20her%2C%2032%20lawmakers,complete%20the%20discussion%20on%20Tuesday).
- Encourage investigative journalism: possibly through state or donor
  grants for journalists to investigate land holdings and deals. It was
  investigative reporting (like in Annapurna Media, Kantipur, etc.) that
  brought many details to light. Protecting press freedom and giving
  them tools (like FOIA requests on land decisions) is vital.

**Systemic Issue 5: Culture of Impunity and Political Interference.** A
core problem has been a **culture of impunity** -- powerful politicians
believed they could get away with bending rules for allies. CIAA
historically not touching "policy" decisions contributed to this, as did
political interference in law enforcement.

- *Recommendation:* **Ensure Accountability at All Levels & Depoliticize
  Oversight Bodies.**
- Follow through on prosecuting those involved in this scandal and
  similar ones. Nothing deters future corruption like seeing a former PM
  or minister actually convicted and punished. The outcome of CIAA's
  investigations (Girbandhu, Lalita Niwas, Patanjali case) will set
  either a positive or negative precedent. The state should **resource
  and empower prosecutors** to see these cases through, even if the
  accused are politically influential.
- Strengthen the independence of accountability institutions: CIAA,
  judiciary, Auditor General, etc. Possibly amend the CIAA law to give
  it more autonomy in selecting cases and protection from dismissal of
  commissioners without cause. Similarly, any attempts to **politicize
  appointments** (like appointing party loyalists as commissioners or
  judges) should be curbed via a more merit-based, transparent
  appointment process.
- Implement a **code of ethics for ministers and MPs** that includes not
  using one's position for personal or associates' enrichment. And have
  an Ethics Committee in Parliament to review any allegations of such
  (e.g., if in the future a suspicion arises that a law is being passed
  to benefit Minister X's friend, the committee can call it out).
- Encourage internal party democracy and accountability: In the case of
  UML, perhaps many cadre knew the Giribandhu move was shady but
  wouldn't speak against the party line. Fostering an internal culture
  where wrongdoing can be questioned without fear (admittedly difficult
  in political parties) could help; this may be more of a societal
  change than a policy, but worth noting.

**Systemic Issue 6: Land Management and Records Infrastructure.** There
are also technical systemic issues -- outdated land maps, unclear
records of government vs private land, etc., which can be exploited. The
fact that Giri Bandhu's Gazette notice was from 1964 and perhaps not
easily accessible in modern databases is one example of potential
record-keeping weakness.

- *Recommendation:* **Modernize Land Information Systems and Personnel
  Training.** Invest in a **Geographic Information System (GIS)** that
  maps all exempt lands and public lands. Train land officers in modern
  techniques to monitor land use (like using satellite imagery or drones
  to see if tea estates are intact). Also, rotate staff regularly in
  land offices to avoid cozy relationships with local land mafias. And
  implement a **Cadastre 2.0** -- an updated cadastre that integrates
  legal data (ownership, rights) with geospatial data, which can
  highlight anomalies (like a single person owning way above the ceiling
  across parcels under different names -- modern data analytics can flag
  that).

**Systemic Issue 7: Public Sector Governance and Integrity.** Underlying
many issues is a need to inculcate **integrity in public service**. Tek
Narayan Pandey's involvement in multiple scams indicates how a single
corrupt bureaucrat can do much harm across sectors. Similarly, ministers
treating their portfolio as fiefdom is a governance culture issue.

- *Recommendation:* **Civil Service Reform & Integrity Initiatives.**
  This could include:
- A robust **asset declaration and verification system** for politicians
  and senior bureaucrats, with random audits. If Oli, Aryal, or Pandey
  had inexplicable wealth changes correlating with such decisions, that
  should be investigable. Making these declarations public could also
  allow civil society to scrutinize.
- **Integrity pacts** in the public sector: For example, when drafting
  legislation, ministries could adopt an integrity pact that they will
  not include clauses favoring individual entities (TI promotes such
  pacts in procurement; it might be novel to apply to lawmaking, but
  conceptually, a ministry pledging that "no hidden beneficiaries" in a
  bill could be considered).
- Incorporate ethics training and anti-corruption modules in the
  orientation of bureaucrats and in continuous training.

Finally, tying these together, a major recommendation is to foster a
culture of **transparency, accountability, and participation** as
guiding principles. As one Transparency International advocate put it,
*"Policy decisions should apply universally, not serve individual
interests"*[\[175\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CQuestions%20about%20what%20constitutes%20a,%E2%80%9D)[\[176\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=unanswered,%E2%80%9D).
This mantra should be codified in Nepal's governance ethos.

**Conclusion (Recovery & Prosecution Efforts):** Nepal has a chance to
**recover lost assets and prosecute offenders** to set a precedent. The
state should pursue reclaiming any ill-gotten gains from this scandal.
For instance, if any land had been transferred or money exchanged (e.g.,
if Malhotra indeed advanced money to Giri or others), mechanisms exist
under Nepali law to confiscate proceeds of corruption. The government
can also consider **nullifying any intermediate transactions** around
the 343 bighas (like those 70 bighas sold earlier -- the SC verdict
suggests even those should be
scrutinized[\[84\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/12/calls-grow-in-parliament-to-probe-giri-bandhu-tea-estate-corruption#:~:text=But%20as%20per%20the%20full,watch%20of%20King%20Gyanendra%20Shah#:~:text=Addressing%20a%20parliamentary%20party%20meeting,in%20return%20for%20hefty%20commissions)).
Prosecutors should not shy away from charging powerful figures -- the
public mood and Supreme Court have provided backing. Should convictions
occur, they must be followed by appropriate sentences (prison, fines,
barring from office) to truly end impunity. On the civil side, expedite
the **integration of those 343 bighas into the government land
registry** as public land so that any future attempts to sell or
encumber it are void.

Implementing these recommendations will not be easy -- it requires
political will and sustained public pressure. However, the Giribandhu
Tea Estate scandal has awakened a broad awareness. There is now momentum
in Nepal for reform: lawmakers across parties have acknowledged the need
to plug
holes[\[40\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=Sher%20Bahadur%20Kunwar%20of%20the,to%20the%20Giribandhu%20Tea%20Estate)[\[42\]](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/29/land-bill-gets-knottier-as-mps-link-it-to-giribandhu-estate#:~:text=to%20prohibit%20land%20granted%20for,including%20apartments%20and%20housing%20plots),
and institutions like CIAA are pushing for
change[\[173\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20bring%20Cabinet,Affairs%20and%20Good%20Governance%20Committee)[\[172\]](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/pressure-on-ciaa-to-investigate-cabinet-decisions/#:~:text=,are%20decided%20beyond%20their%20jurisdiction).
If harnessed, this momentum can lead to **concrete reforms that ensure
transparency, strengthen oversight, and hold wrongdoers accountable**.
In doing so, Nepal can turn the hard lessons of this scandal into
lasting improvements in governance, safeguarding its land resources from
future exploitation.
