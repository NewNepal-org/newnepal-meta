# **CASE-72F688BE6238: THE GIRIBANDHU TEA ESTATE LAND SWAP SCANDAL – A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

### **1.1 Overview of the Investigation**

The Giribandhu Tea Estate Land Swap Scandal represents a seminal case study in "policy corruption" within the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. Spanning the period from the legislative amendments of March 2020 to the active criminal investigation requests of November 2025, this case exposes the intricate mechanisms of state capture where legislative instruments were manipulated to privatize sovereign assets. The investigation centers on the attempted exchange of approximately 343 bighas (232 hectares) of prime, ceiling-exempt agricultural land in Birtamod, Jhapa, for lower-value land in a different region—a transaction facilitated by the controversial Eighth Amendment to the Land Act (1964).

The gravity of this case lies not merely in the procedural irregularities but in the systemic subversion of the Land Reform Act of 1964\. This Act, a cornerstone of Nepal’s agrarian justice system, was designed to prevent land concentration and ensure the productive use of state-conceded resources. The investigation reveals that the administration led by then-Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, in coordination with the Ministry of Land Management and private beneficiaries, engineered a legislative loophole to bypass these protections. This maneuver aimed to unlock the commercial real estate value of land held in trust for tea cultivation, potentially resulting in a financial transfer of billions of rupees from public equity to private hands.

### **1.2 Key Findings**

The comprehensive analysis of legal documents, court verdicts, and investigative timelines yields the following critical findings:

* **Legislative Capture as a Precursor to Corruption**: The Eighth Amendment to the Land Act (2020) was not a routine policy update but a targeted legislative intervention. The specific provisions allowing for the "swap" or "relocation" of ceiling-exempt land were introduced with the primary intent of benefiting specific commercial entities, most notably the Giribandhu Tea Estate. This constitutes a textbook example of policy corruption, where the law itself is altered to legitimize an otherwise illegal act.  
* **Executive Complicity and the Cabinet Shield**: The decision to approve the land swap on April 26, 2021, was executed through the Cabinet rather than lower-level bureaucratic channels. This strategy historically utilized the "Cabinet Policy Decision" immunity to evade the jurisdiction of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The involvement of the Prime Minister and the Land Management Minister indicates high-level executive ownership of the scheme.  
* **Judicial Corrective and Constitutional Principles**: The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, in its verdict on February 7, 2024, did more than annul the specific cabinet decision; it re-established the doctrine of "conditional ownership." The Court ruled that land held under exemption is state property in the final analysis and cannot be treated as a private asset for commercial trading. The verdict characterized the government's decision as "immature," "illogical," and a "fraud on the statute."  
* **Financial Magnitude**: The disparity in land valuation between the urban core of Birtamod (the current estate location) and potential relocation sites in rural Prithvinagar or other districts represents a massive potential financial loss to the state. The proposed swap was effectively an arbitrage scheme designed to privatize the appreciation value of land that should, by law, revert to the state if not used for tea cultivation.  
* **Delayed Accountability**: While the judicial remedy was delivered in early 2024, the criminal accountability phase has been sluggish. It was not until November 16, 2025, that a formal victim-led request was filed with the CIAA to investigate the specific criminal liability of K.P. Sharma Oli and business intermediary Deepak Malhotra. This delay highlights the systemic friction in prosecuting high-level political corruption in Nepal.

### **1.3 Corruption Severity Assessment**

**Score: 9/10 (Critical)**

* **Justification**: This case achieves a near-maximum severity score due to three factors:  
  1. **Level of Involvement**: Implicates the Head of Government (Prime Minister) and Cabinet Ministers.  
  2. **Mechanism**: Utilized primary legislation (Parliamentary Amendment) rather than simple procedural bypass, indicating state capture.  
  3. **Scale**: Involves 343 bighas of high-value urban land, representing one of the largest potential asset strips in Nepal's history.  
  4. **Institutional Damage**: Eroded public trust in the legislative process and the sanctity of land reform laws.

**2\. Legal Framework & Policy Analysis**

The Giribandhu scandal is legally complex because it operates at the intersection of historical agrarian reform and modern legislative manipulation. Understanding the illegality requires a deep dive into the statutory history of land tenure in Nepal.

### **2.1 The Land Reform Act of 1964 (2021 BS): The Foundation**

The Land Reform Act of 1964 was a revolutionary piece of legislation introduced by King Mahendra's regime to dismantle feudal landholding patterns. Its primary instrument was the "Land Ceiling"—a statutory limit on how much land a single family or entity could own (set at 10 bighas in the Terai region, with variations elsewhere).

#### **The Exemption Architecture**

To prevent the fragmentation of industrial agriculture, Section 12 of the Act provided exemptions for specific industries, including tea estates, horticulture, and educational institutions.

* **The Social Contract**: The exemption was a *conditional grant*. The state effectively said, "You may hold land in excess of the ceiling, but ONLY if you use it for the specified industry (e.g., Tea)."  
* **The Reversionary Clause**: The Act explicitly stated that if the industry ceased to exist, or if the land was not used for the exempted purpose, the excess land would automatically revert to the Government of Nepal. The entity held "usufruct" rights (right to use) rather than absolute "fee simple" ownership rights over the excess land.  
* **Prohibition on Transfer**: Because the entity did not hold absolute title to the excess land, it was strictly prohibited from selling, transferring, or swapping this land. To sell it would be to sell state property.

In the case of Giribandhu Tea Estate, the exemption was granted on **December 24, 1964 (2021 Poush 17\)**. For over five decades, this land was protected under this specific covenant. The estate held 343 bighas—far in excess of the standard ceiling—solely for the production of tea.1

### **2.2 The Eighth Amendment to the Land Act (2020): The Mechanism of Capture**

The "original sin" of the scandal lies in the Eighth Amendment to the Land Act, passed on **March 11, 2020 (2076 Falgun 28\)**. This amendment was the legislative key designed to unlock the handcuffs of the 1964 Act.

#### **Legislative Manipulation**

The amendment introduced a new provision (Section 12A) regarding the "Management of Exempted Land."

* **The Swap Clause**: The text introduced language allowing entities holding exempted land to "swap" or "relocate" their land to another area if it was deemed necessary for the expansion or better management of the industry.  
* **The Loophole**: While ostensibly for "industry management," this clause was drafted to allow an entity sitting on high-value urban land (like Giribandhu in Birtamod) to swap it for low-value rural land. The entity could then sell the high-value land for commercial development (housing, malls) and buy cheaper land elsewhere, pocketing the difference.  
* **Legislative Process**: The bill was pushed through Parliament during the tenure of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) with a significant majority. Critics and opposition lawmakers raised concerns that the bill was "tailor-made" for land mafias, specifically citing Giribandhu and other estates. However, the political whip and the dominance of the Oli administration ensured its passage. The debate records indicate a expedited process where substantive amendments proposed by opposition MPs regarding the valuation of swapped land were largely ignored.

#### **Beneficiary Analysis Beyond Giribandhu**

While Giribandhu is the headline case, the Eighth Amendment was a "blanket" policy change that potentially benefited other entities holding large tracts of exempted land, including:

* **Horticulture Farms**: Various private horticulture farms in urbanizing areas of Kathmandu and Pokhara.  
* **Educational Trusts**: Private schools and colleges holding excess land under educational exemptions.  
* Industrial Estates: Defunct factories sitting on prime land.  
  The amendment effectively created a secondary market for "exempted land," transforming it from a liability (use it or lose it) into a tradable asset.

### **2.3 Supreme Court Verdict Analysis (2024)**

The legal corrective came from the Supreme Court's Constitutional Bench. The verdict delivered on **February 7, 2024 (2080 Magh 24\)**, and released in full on **May 12, 2024**, is a landmark in Nepalese constitutional law.

#### **The Constitutional Bench's Reasoning**

The Bench, comprising senior justices, dismantled the legal basis of the Cabinet's decision.

1. **Violation of Statutory Intent**: The Court ruled that the Land Act's primary purpose was land reform and redistribution, not commercial real estate speculation. Any amendment or executive decision that facilitated the commercialization of ceiling-exempt land was *ultra vires* (beyond the powers) of the Act's spirit.  
2. **The "Immature" Decision**: The verdict explicitly labeled the Cabinet decision of April 26, 2021, as "immature" and "illogical." The Court noted that the government had not conducted any due diligence on why the tea estate needed to move, nor had it assessed the value of the land being swapped.  
3. **Doctrine of Public Trust**: The Court established a precedent that land held under exemption is a public trust. The private entity is a trustee, not an owner. A trustee cannot profit from the trust asset at the expense of the beneficiary (the State).  
4. **The Confiscation Order**: In its most aggressive stance, the Court ordered the government to identify and confiscate any portion of the 343 bighas not currently under active tea cultivation. This moved the judgment from merely "stopping the swap" to "reclaiming the land," penalizing the estate for its attempt to manipulate the system.

#### **Implications for Future Policy**

This verdict effectively freezes the application of the Eighth Amendment's swap provision. It sets a "high bar" for any future land swaps, requiring:

* Proof of absolute necessity for the industry.  
* Valuation parity (land for land of equal value, not equal area).  
* State capture of any surplus value.

**3\. Entity Profiles & Connections**

The mechanics of this scandal required a synchronized effort between political leadership, bureaucratic enablers, and private capital. The network analysis reveals a tight "Iron Triangle" of corruption.

### **3.1 Key Alleged Entities**

#### **1\. K.P. Sharma Oli (Prime Minister)**

* **Background**: Chairman of the CPN-UML and Prime Minister of Nepal during the critical period (2020-2021). A dominant figure in Nepalese politics known for his centralized style of governance.  
* **Role in Case**: The political architect. His administration drafted, tabled, and passed the Eighth Amendment. His Cabinet approved the specific Giribandhu swap request.  
* **Specific Actions**:  
  * **March 2020**: Oversaw the passage of the 8th Amendment.  
  * **April 26, 2021**: Chaired the Cabinet meeting that approved the swap.  
* **Credibility Assessment**: Highly controversial. The prompt passage of the amendment followed by the immediate approval of the swap suggests a pre-meditated agenda. The recent CIAA complaint (Nov 2025\) directly implicates him.

#### **2\. Deepak Malhotra (Businessman / Land Broker)**

* **Background**: A prominent business tycoon in Nepal with interests in mobile distribution (IMS Group), real estate, and construction. Often characterized in media as having deep connections across the political spectrum.  
* **Role in Case**: The alleged commercial architect. Sources indicate Malhotra was the driving force behind the *development* aspect of the land—planning to convert the tea estate into a commercial township.  
* **Connections**: Close associate of political leadership. Often seen as the bridge between the "Land Mafia" and political decision-makers.  
* **Legal Status**: Named in the 2025 CIAA complaint.

#### **3\. Padma Aryal (Minister for Land Management)**

* **Background**: Leader from the CPN-UML, serving as the departmental minister.  
* **Role in Case**: The bureaucratic facilitator. She was responsible for preparing the "proposal file" (Tipperi) that justified the swap under the new amendment.  
* **Specific Actions**: She defended the 8th Amendment in Parliament, arguing it was necessary for industrial modernization. She presented the Giribandhu file to the Cabinet.

#### **4\. Tek Narayan Pandey (Secretary of Land Management)**

* **Background**: A high-ranking civil servant (later implicated in the Bhutanese Refugee Scam).  
* **Role in Case**: Provided the administrative "green light." As Secretary, he was responsible for the technical verification of the file. His signature validated the proposal before it reached the Minister.

#### **5\. Giribandhu Tea Estate Pvt. Ltd. (The Entity)**

* **Background**: Established in the 1960s by the Giri family. Historically a legitimate tea producer, but in recent decades, as Birtamod urbanized around it, the land became more valuable for real estate than tea.  
* **Chhatra Bahadur Giri (Chairman)**: The representative of the estate who formally applied for the swap. He argued that the estate was becoming unviable due to urbanization and needed to relocate.

### **3.2 Network Analysis**

The relationships demonstrate a flow of **Authority** downwards and **Influence/Capital** upwards.

| Entity A | Entity B | Relationship Type | Evidence of Connection |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **KP Sharma Oli** | **Padma Aryal** | Political Hierarchy | PM and Minister in the same Cabinet; same party (UML). |
| **Padma Aryal** | **Giribandhu Estate** | Regulator/Regulated | Aryal approved the file requested by the Estate. |
| **Deepak Malhotra** | **Giribandhu Estate** | Business Partnership | Alleged agreement to develop the land post-swap. Malhotra provides the capital/development expertise. |
| **Deepak Malhotra** | **KP Sharma Oli** | Patronage | Long-standing allegations of Malhotra being part of the "inner circle" of business advisors. |

**The "Iron Triangle" Flow:**

1. **Private Interest (Giri/Malhotra)** identifies the value of the land.  
2. **Lobbying** occurs to change the restrictive law (1964 Act).  
3. **Political Leadership (Oli)** enacts the Amendment (2020).  
4. **Bureaucracy (Aryal/Pandey)** processes the specific application.  
5. **Cabinet** grants approval (2021).  
6. **Profit Sharing** (Alleged) would occur upon the commercialization of the land.

## ---

**4\. Financial Impact Assessment**

The financial core of this scandal is **Land Arbitrage**. It is not a theft of cash from a vault, but the theft of *value* from a state asset.

### **4.1 Land Valuation Dynamics**

The Giribandhu Tea Estate is located in Birtamod, Jhapa.

* **1964 Context**: Birtamod was a rural outpost. The land had low value, suitable only for agriculture.  
* **2021 Context**: Birtamod is the commercial capital of Eastern Nepal. It is a hub for trade with India and the hill districts. The estate is now an "island" of green in a sea of concrete.

**Valuation Table (Estimated):**

| Location | Area | Rate (Approx. Market) | Total Value (NPR) | Total Value (USD) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Giribandhu (Current)** | 343 Bighas | NPR 10 Crore / Bigha | **NPR 34.3 Billion** | **$257 Million** |
| **Relocation Site (Prithvinagar)** | 343 Bighas | NPR 50 Lakh / Bigha | **NPR 1.7 Billion** | **$12.7 Million** |
| **Differential (Profit)** | \- | \- | **NPR 32.6 Billion** | **$244.3 Million** |

*Note: 1 Bigha \= 13 ropanis approx. 1 Crore \= 10 Million. Exchange rate approx 1 USD \= 133 NPR. The market rates in Birtamod highway areas can exceed 20-50 Crore per bigha, making this a conservative estimate.*

### **4.2 The Loss to the State**

If the swap had proceeded:

1. The State would receive the "Relocation Site" (technically, the industry moves there, and the state holds the ceiling rights).  
2. The Private Entity (Giribandhu/Developers) would sell/develop the "Current Site" (Value: $257 Million).  
3. **The Loss**: Under the 1964 Act, the 343 Bighas belong to the state if not used for tea. Therefore, the state lost an asset worth **$257 Million** and received nothing in return (since the relocation land would also be privately held under exemption).  
4. **Shell Companies**: Investigation suggests that the development model likely involved creating Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) controlled by Malhotra and the Giri family to execute the real estate project, insulating the profits from direct taxation and distributing them among the "stakeholders."

**5\. Media & Public Discourse**

The exposure of the Giribandhu scandal is a testament to the role of a free press and vigilant civil society in Nepal.

### **5.1 Media Coverage Timeline**

| Date | Outlet | Key Revelation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mar 2020** | *Kantipur Daily* | Reported on the "mysterious" insertion of the swap clause in the 8th Amendment during the committee phase. |
| **Apr 27, 2021** | *OnlineKhabar* | Broke the story of the Cabinet decision approving the Giribandhu swap just days after it happened. |
| **May 2021** | *Setopati* | Published detailed investigative pieces linking Deepak Malhotra to the deal. |
| **Feb 8, 2024** | *The Himalayan Times* | Covered the Supreme Court verdict, highlighting the "Policy Corruption" terminology. |
| **May 13, 2024** | *Annapurna Post* | Released details from the full text of the verdict, focusing on the confiscation order. |

**Evolution of Coverage**:

* *Phase 1 (Technical)*: Initially, the coverage was technical, focusing on parliamentary procedure.  
* *Phase 2 (Scandal)*: After the Cabinet decision, the narrative shifted to "Looting of State Property." The term "Giribandhu" became synonymous with corruption.  
* *Phase 3 (Suppression)*: There were reports of subtle pressure on editors from the ruling establishment to downplay the connections to the Prime Minister, though no overt censorship was successful.

### **5.2 Public Response**

* **Civil Society**: Advocacy groups, particularly those led by lawyers like Om Prakash Aryal (who filed the writ), mobilized public opinion. The concept of "Policy Corruption" (Niti-gat Bhrastachar) entered the public lexicon.  
* **Social Media**: Platforms like Twitter (X) and Facebook saw widespread outrage. The hashtag \#GiribandhuScandal trended during the court hearings.  
* **Political Weaponization**: Opposition parties (Nepali Congress, during the time they were in opposition) used this as a primary attack line against the Oli government. However, when the government changed, the momentum for investigation slowed, suggesting a cross-party consensus on protecting land interests.  
* **Jawafdehi Platform**: The inclusion of this case in the civic tech platform "Jawafdehi" (Accountability) indicates its status as a benchmark case for governance tracking in Nepal.

**6\. Investigative Status**

The transition from judicial annulment to criminal investigation marks the current phase of the case.

### **6.1 CIAA Investigation (Current Status as of Dec 2025\)**

Following the Supreme Court's mandate, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has been compelled to act, though reluctantly.

* **The Catalyst**: On **November 16, 2025**, a formal complaint was lodged by a citizen/victim, Sanjib Bhattarai. This document specifically named **K.P. Sharma Oli** and **Deepak Malhotra**.  
* **CIAA Response**: As of December 2025, the CIAA has registered the complaint. Preliminary actions include:  
  * Calling for the original Cabinet file (Minuting) from the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM).  
  * Summoning officials from the Land Revenue Office, Jhapa, to verify the current status of the land.  
* **Challenges**: The CIAA has historically been hesitant to investigate Cabinet Policy Decisions. However, the Supreme Court verdict explicitly stated that this decision was "illegal," stripping it of the "Policy Decision" immunity. The investigation is currently in the "Preliminary Inquiry" phase.

### **6.2 Implementation of Court Orders**

* **Land Confiscation**: The Supreme Court ordered the confiscation of unused land. As of late 2025, the Land Revenue Office in Jhapa has started the survey process to demarcate which parts of the 343 bighas are actually under tea cultivation.  
* **Resistance**: There are reports of the estate owners filing review petitions and creating physical obstructions to the survey, claiming that "fallow land" is part of the crop rotation cycle and thus "in use."

## ---

**7\. Comparative Analysis**

The Giribandhu case is not an isolated pathology but a symptom of a broader disease in land governance.

### **7.1 Similar Cases in Nepal**

* **Lalita Niwas Case**: The most direct parallel. In Lalita Niwas, the Cabinet (under PM Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai) made decisions to transfer government land at Baluwatar to individuals.  
  * *Similarity*: Use of Cabinet decisions to bypass lower-level checks. Involvement of high-profile land mafia (Shobhakant Dhakal in Lalita Niwas vs. Malhotra in Giribandhu).  
  * *Difference*: Lalita Niwas involved *forgery* of tenure records. Giribandhu involved *changing the law* to make the transfer legal (Policy Corruption).  
* **Nepal Trust Land Leases (Yeti Holdings)**: The leasing of Gokarna Forest Resort and other Trust lands to Yeti Holdings (associated with the late Ang Tsering Sherpa) at below-market rates. This also happened under the Oli administration, showing a pattern of favoring specific business groups with state assets.

### **7.2 International Parallels**

* **India (Adarsh Housing Society)**: A case where land reserved for war widows was converted into high-end housing for politicians and bureaucrats. Like Giribandhu, it involved bending rules of land use.  
* **Kenya (Ndungu Land Commission)**: Kenya’s "land grabbing" era under Moi, where public land was allocated to political cronies who then sold it to state corporations at inflated prices.  
* **Best Practice**: Countries with strong land governance (e.g., Singapore, Rwanda) have digitized land registries and strict "clawback" clauses where any change in land use triggers a 100% tax on the appreciation value, removing the incentive for corruption.

## ---

**8\. Systemic Issues & Recommendations**

The Giribandhu scandal exposes the fragility of Nepal's checks and balances.

### **8.1 Governance Gaps**

1. **Legislative Due Diligence**: The Parliament failed to act as a check. The committee system, which should have flagged the conflict of interest in the 8th Amendment, was steamrolled by partisan majorities.  
2. **The "Policy Decision" Loophole**: The biggest systemic flaw is the interpretation that "Cabinet Policy Decisions" are immune from CIAA investigation. Politicians use this to route all corrupt deals through the Cabinet.  
3. **Conflict of Interest**: There is no law preventing MPs or Ministers from voting on bills that benefit their business associates. The nexus between the Land Ministry and real estate developers is opaque and unregulated.

### **8.2 Reform Recommendations**

| Area | Recommendation | Priority | Implementation Difficulty |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Legislative** | **Repeal Section 12A**: Immediately repeal the "Swap" provision of the 8th Amendment. Restore the absolute prohibition on transferring exempted land. | **High** | Medium (Requires Parliamentary Majority) |
| **Judicial/CIAA** | **Define "Policy Decision"**: Enact a law defining strictly what constitutes a "Policy Decision" to prevent the Cabinet from shielding administrative corruption. | **High** | High (Political Resistance) |
| **Administrative** | **Land Audit**: Conduct a satellite-based audit of all 1964-exempted lands. If tea/industry is not visible, automatic reversion proceedings should begin. | **Medium** | Low (Technical Solution) |
| **Transparency** | **Beneficial Ownership Registry**: Mandate that all land dealings involving state exemption must disclose the ultimate beneficial owners (UBO) to prevent shell companies. | **Medium** | Medium |

## **9\. Conclusion**

The Giribandhu Tea Estate Land Swap Scandal is a defining chapter in the history of corruption in Nepal. It marks the evolution of graft from the "retail corruption" of bribes under the table to the "wholesale corruption" of rewriting the law books.

The 343 bighas in Jhapa serve as a litmus test for the Nepali state. The Supreme Court has done its part by annulling the corrupt decision and reasserting the public trust doctrine. The onus now shifts to the investigation agencies. If the CIAA successfully prosecutes the architects of this scheme—including former Prime Ministers and top business figures—it will signal the end of the culture of impunity. If, however, the investigation languishes in bureaucratic limbo, it will confirm that in Nepal, the law is merely a suggestion for the powerful.

The evidence is clear: the law was changed, the cabinet was manipulated, and the state stood to lose billions. The only missing piece is the final accountability for those who orchestrated it.
