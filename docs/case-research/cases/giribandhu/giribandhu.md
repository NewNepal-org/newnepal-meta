## Case Summary

### Short Description (1-2 sentences)
A major land corruption scandal involving an attempt to illegally swap 343 bighas of prime tea estate land in Birtamod, Jhapa for cheaper land elsewhere, facilitated by the Oli government's controversial 2020 amendment to the Land Act. The Supreme Court annulled the scheme in February 2024, calling it "immature" and "illogical," and ordered confiscation of land not used for tea cultivation.

### Detailed Description
The Giribandhu Tea Estate scandal represents one of Nepal's most significant cases of "policy corruption" - where laws were deliberately amended to benefit private interests at public expense. In 1964 A.D, Giribandhu Tea Estate received an exemption from land ceiling limits for 343-19-12-0 bighas near Birtamod, Jhapa, on the strict condition that the land be used exclusively for tea cultivation and could not be bought, sold, or leased.

In early 2020, the K.P. Sharma Oli government pushed through the Eighth Amendment to the Land Act, creating a loophole that allowed companies holding exempt land to swap or sell it if they claimed to be in liquidation. On April 26, 2021, Oli's Cabinet approved Giribandhu Tea Estate's request to swap its valuable Birtamod land (worth an estimated Rs 200 million per bigha) for much cheaper land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.

The scheme involved a network of powerful actors: Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, Land Minister Padma Kumari Aryal, Land Ministry Secretary Tek Narayan Pandey, estate owner Chhatra Bahadur Giri, and businessman Deepak Kumar Malhotra. The plan would have allowed the conversion of protected agricultural land into a lucrative real estate development, potentially generating profits in the tens of billions of rupees for private parties while violating the fundamental principles of Nepal's land reform.

Following a writ petition by advocate Om Prakash Aryal in May 2021, the Supreme Court issued an interim order halting the swap in August 2021. On February 7, 2024, a Constitutional Bench delivered a landmark verdict annulling the Cabinet decision and ordering the government to confiscate any land not being used for tea cultivation. The Court established strict criteria for any future land swaps and reaffirmed that exempt land is a privilege for public purpose, not a tradable commodity.

Despite the verdict, the Oli government attempted to bypass it by issuing an ordinance in January 2025 with similar provisions, leading to a contempt of court petition.

In November 2025, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched a formal investigation into the scandal. The case has become a watershed moment for land governance in Nepal, influencing ongoing legislative reforms and demonstrating the judiciary's role in checking executive overreach.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, 51 bighas of the exempt land were illegally or questionably sold off with Cabinet approvals, despite the explicit prohibition on sale. These transactions occurred during various governments, including under King Gyanendra Shah's watch, shrinking the estate's holdings and setting a precedent for future violations.

This directly contradicted the 2021 B.S. Land Act's prohibition on sale or exchange of exempt land.

### Event 10
- **Date**: 2024-02-07 (२०८० माघ २४)
- **Title**: Supreme Court Constitutional Bench Verdict (०७८-WC-०००४)
- **Description**: A Constitutional Bench led by Chief Justice Bishowambhar P. Shrestha delivered a landmark verdict annulling the Oli Cabinet's April 26, 2021 decision. The Court called the decision "immature," "illogical," and contrary to the spirit of the Land Act. The verdict issued a certiorari nullifying the Cabinet order and a mandamus directing the government to confiscate any excess land not being used for tea cultivation and keep it under state ownership. The Court established seven strict criteria for any future land swaps, including requirements for similar productive capacity, feasibility studies, environmental assessments, and equivalent land values. The verdict stopped short of striking down the Eighth Amendment itself but found its application in this case violated the Act's intent. The ruling emphasized that exempt land above ceilings is not meant to be traded and that exemptions are privileges for public purpose, not rights to profiteer.

He challenged the government to either facilitate a resolution or compensate the family and take over the land.
