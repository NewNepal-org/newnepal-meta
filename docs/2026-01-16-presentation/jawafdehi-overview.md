## जवाफदेही (*jawafdehi.org*)

**Interconnecting Nepal's Civic Accountability Infrastructure**

## Nepal's Accountability Crisis

**September 2025 Gen-Z Protests**: Young Nepalis took to the streets demanding an end to the culture of impunity—leaders implicated in corruption who continue to hold power, investigations that stall indefinitely, and accountability organs captured by political forces.

**But fundamental capacity remains weak**: As Nepal remains weak in accountability fundamentals—citizen literacy, digitization, and institutional independence, GenZ demands remains at risk of being unmet.

---

## Elections alone will not fulfill the Gen-Z mandate for accountability -- robust civic infrastructure is needed.
