Jawafdehi is an open-source civic technology platform for Nepal that seeks to build long-term institutional memory against corruption by making allegations, evidence, timelines, and outcomes structured, searchable, and accessible.

## Executive summary

*Problem*: Corruption-related information in Nepal is fragmented across reports, PDFs, headlines, and social media, while official information is often not readily accessible from CIAA and other government sources. At the same time, social media posts often suffer from misinformation, out-of-context, and click-bait information. Although many civic organizations, media groups, and investigative journalists work to expose corruption, Nepal still lacks an accessible, centralized corruption database that people can search, compare, and track over time.

*Solution*: Jawafdehi turns that fragmentation into a civic-led public accountability database: a centralized place to compile allegations against Nepali public entities from government, NGO, media, and citizen sources, with evidence-first documentation (including timelines) and Nepali entity linking so information remains usable beyond headlines and election cycles. It was born from a Gen‑Z mandate for transparency and accountability: when public institutions cannot reliably ensure that powerful individuals and organizations are held accountable, independent civic infrastructure becomes a necessity. To scale this work, Jawafdehi uses technology, including GenAI-assisted extraction and structuring of information, while maintaining integrity through human-in-the-loop verification, moderation, and a right-to-respond mechanism.


## Mission

Short term/near-term focus: Track and document corruption and misconduct allegations in Nepal in an accessible, evidence-first database.

Long term (accountability framework): Expand beyond individual cases into a broader accountability system that helps hold public actors accountable based on publicly verifiable criteria, such as:

- Hold politicians accountable based on election promises vs delivery.
- Hold public officials accountable based on credible accusations of misconduct, bribery, and other corruption-related activities, with evidence trails and right of reply.
- Hold media companies and journalists accountable based on journalistic principles (accuracy, sourcing, corrections, conflicts of interest, and separation of news vs opinion).
- Hold the justice process (courts, prosecutors, and judges) accountable by tracking case progression, due process, and outcomes (investigation, prosecution, verdicts, sanctions), as well as unexplained delays.
- Hold non-profits and civic organizations accountable based on transparency and governance (funding disclosures, conflicts of interest, program delivery, and public reporting).

## What Jawafdehi does

1. Publish a centralized, searchable database of corruption and misconduct allegations, enabling the public to browse, search, and filter cases over time.
2. Provide evidence-first case pages, including timelines, sources, and supporting artifacts (not just viral summaries).
3. Link cases to people and organizations through entity profiles, helping surface patterns across repeated actors and institutions.
4. Enable a citizen reporting pathway (anonymous or named) with supporting evidence uploads.
5. Maintain integrity through human-in-the-loop moderation and an audit trail that preserves what changed, when, and why.
6. Support right of reply through an accused-entity response flow, with identity verification and supporting documents.
7. Operate with an open-source and open-data approach to support reuse across Nepal’s civic ecosystem.
8. Use technology to scale responsibly, including GenAI-assisted extraction and structuring, with human review as the final gate.

### Safeguards & Data Integrity

1. **Allegations vs. findings:** Jawafdehi documents allegations; content should be explicitly labeled by status (Draft/In Review/Published/Closed) and phrased appropriately.
2. **Sources & evidence:** Cases are built around supporting sources and evidence artifacts; provenance matters.
3. **Auditability:** The platform maintains revision history to prevent silent changes and to preserve public trust.
4. **Human moderation:** Submissions are reviewed before publication; AI (where used) is assistive, not authoritative.
5. **Right of reply:** Entities can submit responses and supporting documents via a verification workflow.
6. **Protection & privacy:** Redact sensitive personal identification information where needed, and minimize harm to both contributors and alleged entities while preserving public-interest accountability.

## Partnerships

1. **Journalists & media:** We can provide structured corruption allegation data, evidence trails, entity cross-linking, and technical integration support; we need collaboration on investigations, verification feedback, and responsible publication practices.
2. **Civil society & non-profits:** We can provide evidence-backed case documentation and datasets for monitoring and advocacy; we need domain expertise, shared case information, and support in verification workflows.
3. **Academia:** We can provide structured datasets with provenance and auditability; we need research collaborations, methodological input, and independent feedback on data quality.
