# Jawafdehi: Nepal Incorporation Research

*Research date: 2026-02-28 | ~15 founding members*

---

## Executive Summary

Jawafdehi is currently described as "Pending incorporation" in official documents. This research provides a comprehensive guide to formally registering Jawafdehi as a legal entity in Nepal, covering entity types, registration process, SWC affiliation, diaspora member considerations, costs, and timeline.

**Recommendation:** Register Jawafdehi as an **NGO under the Associations Registration Act, 2034** at the national level (registered at a Kathmandu District Administration Office), followed by affiliation with the **Social Welfare Council (SWC)**. This mirrors the structure of comparable civic accountability organizations — notably Transparency International Nepal, which is registered at the Kathmandu DAO and affiliated with the SWC.

---

## 1. Entity Type Options

Nepal offers two primary legal forms for a non-profit civic tech organization:

### Option A: NGO / Social Organization (Recommended)
- **Governing Law**: Associations Registration Act, 2034 (1977)
- **Registration Authority**: District Administration Office (DAO)
- **Minimum Founders**: 7 Nepali citizens
- **Best For**: Civic advocacy, accountability, grant-funded operations
- **Tax Benefits**: Greater (tax-exempt status under Income Tax Act, 2058)
- **SWC Affiliation**: Required for foreign funding

### Option B: Non-Profit (Profit-Not-Distributing) Company
- **Governing Law**: Companies Act, 2063 (2006)
- **Registration Authority**: Office of the Company Registrar (OCR)
- **Minimum Founders**: 5 members
- **Best For**: Social enterprises with revenue-generating activities
- **Operational Flexibility**: Higher, but fewer tax benefits
- **SWC Affiliation**: Still required for foreign funding

### Comparison Table

| Feature | NGO (Association) | Non-Profit Company (PNDC) |
|---|---|---|
| Governing Law | Associations Registration Act, 2034 | Companies Act, 2063 |
| Min. Members | 7 | 5 |
| Registered With | District Administration Office (DAO) | Office of the Company Registrar (OCR) |
| Registration Time | 1–2 months | ~1 week (OCR) + statutory registrations |
| Tax Benefits | More extensive | Fewer |
| Operational Flexibility | Less | More |
| SWC Required? | Only for foreign funds | Only for foreign funds |
| Best For | Purely civic/advocacy work | Social enterprises, revenue-generating |

### What Comparable Organizations Use

| Organization | Entity Type | Registration |
|---|---|---|
| Transparency International Nepal | NGO | Kathmandu DAO + SWC affiliated |
| Accountability Lab Nepal | NGO | DAO + SWC affiliated |
| Daayitwa | NGO | DAO + SWC affiliated |

**Conclusion**: Given Jawafdehi's mission — civic advocacy, open data, grant-funded operations — the **NGO structure** is appropriate and aligns with the models of Transparency International Nepal, Accountability Lab, and Daayitwa.

## 2. Registration Level: National vs. District

| Feature | District-Level | National-Level |
|---|---|---|
| Operational Area | Single district | Multiple districts nationwide |
| Policy Advocacy | Limited | Full access |
| Donor Access | Limited | Broader donor programs |
| Government Fees | ~NPR 4,000–6,000 | ~NPR 10,000–15,000 |
| Registration Time | 1–8 weeks | 4–8 weeks |

**Recommendation**: **National-level registration** is appropriate for Jawafdehi because:
1. The platform serves citizens across Nepal
2. Jawafdehi has already engaged with the national government (submitted feedback to the PM's office on the Second National Anti-Corruption Strategy)
3. National-level registration enables engagement with international donors
4. The operational scope needs to cover all of Nepal

*Note: The operational scope (national vs. district) must be declared in the constitution at time of registration. Expanding scope later requires additional approval.*

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Registration Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Registration Preparation

**Step 1: Identify Eligible Founding Members**
- Minimum 7 Nepali citizens (holding valid Nepali citizenship certificate)
- Jawafdehi has ~15 total members — well above the minimum
- Executive positions needed: President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and additional members
- **Important**: Only members holding Nepali citizenship can be founding/executive committee members (see Section 5 on diaspora members)

**Step 2: Name Reservation**
- Verify the name "जवाफदेही" is not already registered with the DAO
- Can search at the DAO office or engage a legal firm for name verification
- Note: "Jawafdehi" is a common Nepali word; consider a more unique full name, e.g., "Jawafdehi Nepal" or "Jawafdehi Foundation"

**Step 3: Draft the Constitution (Bidhan/विधान)**
The constitution must include:
- Name and registered office address (Kathmandu recommended for national-level)
- Objectives and mission statement
- Membership eligibility criteria, rights, and duties
- Governance structure: General Assembly, Executive Committee, roles
- Financial management procedures
- Meeting procedures and quorum requirements
- Amendment procedures
- Dissolution and asset distribution clause (assets must go to a similar non-profit)

This is the most critical document. Engage a legal professional to draft it.

**Step 4: Founding Meeting**
- Hold a formal founding/constituent meeting (साधारण सभा)
- All founding members must attend in person or provide notarized authorization
- Pass the constitution
- Elect the Executive Committee
- Record formal meeting minutes (detailed)

---

### Phase 2: Ward Office Recommendation

**Step 5: Ward Office Application**
- Apply to the **local Ward Office** where Jawafdehi's registered office will be located
- Submit: application letter, draft constitution, founding meeting minutes, copies of citizenship certificates of all members, passport photos
- Obtain: **Recommendation Letter** from the Ward Office

*Estimated time: 3–7 days*

---

### Phase 3: District Coordination Committee (DCC)

**Step 6: DCC Endorsement**
- Submit Ward Office recommendation and all documents to the **District Coordination Committee (DCC)**
- DCC provides its own endorsement/recommendation

*Estimated time: 3–7 days*

---

### Phase 4: DAO Registration

**Step 7: Submit to District Administration Office (DAO)**

Required documents for DAO submission:
- Application form (available at the DAO)
- Constitution (Bidhan) — certified copies
- Founding meeting minutes
- Ward Office recommendation letter
- DCC recommendation
- Copies of citizenship certificates of all founding members
- Passport-sized photographs of all members
- Police character certificates for all executive committee members (from Nepal Police)
- Proof of registered office (rent agreement or ownership document for office premises)
- Application fee payment receipt

**Step 8: DAO Review and Registration**
- DAO reviews documents and may conduct verification visits
- Upon approval, issues the **Certificate of Registration** (दर्ता प्रमाण-पत्र)
- This is the primary legal recognition of Jawafdehi as an organization

*Estimated time: 2–4 weeks from submission*

---

### Phase 5: Post-DAO Compliance

**Step 9: PAN Registration (Inland Revenue Department)**
- Mandatory for opening a bank account and receiving funds
- Apply at the Inland Revenue Department with the Registration Certificate
- Obtain a **Permanent Account Number (PAN)**

**Step 10: Bank Account**
- Open an organizational bank account using the Registration Certificate and PAN
- All organizational funds must flow through this account

**Step 11: Social Welfare Council (SWC) Affiliation** *(if foreign funding planned)*
See Section 4 below for details.

---

## 4. Social Welfare Council (SWC) Affiliation

### Is It Mandatory?
SWC affiliation is **not legally mandatory** under Section 13 of the Social Welfare Act, 1992. However, it is **de facto required** if Jawafdehi intends to:
- Receive grants from international donors, foundations, or foreign governments
- Work with international partner organizations
- Seek legitimacy for government engagement

Given Jawafdehi's civic mission and likely need for international partnerships and funding, SWC affiliation is strongly recommended.

### SWC Affiliation Documents Required
- Application form from SWC
- Copy of DAO Registration Certificate
- Ward Office recommendation letter
- DCC certificate
- Organization's Constitution (Bidhan)
- Certified copies of citizenship certificates of all board members
- Passport-sized photographs of board members
- Police character clearance certificates for all board members
- Rent agreement for office premises (mandatory)
- Photocopy of PAN certificate
- Auditor's license and tax certificate (if applicable)
- Minutes of the meeting electing board members
- List of board members

### SWC Affiliation Process for Foreign Funding
Under Article 16(1) of the Social Welfare Act, any social organization seeking assistance from foreign governments, international organizations, or individuals must:
1. Submit a project proposal to the SWC
2. SWC processes in coordination with the relevant ministry within **45 days**
3. For small projects (under NPR 200,000), only advance notification is required

### SWC Contact Information
- **Address**: Hariharbhawan, Lalitpur, Nepal
- **Phone**: +977-01-5455495 | 5455448 | 5455494
- **Email**: info@swc.org.np
- **Website**: www.swc.org.np

## 5. Diaspora Member Considerations

This is critical given that Jawafdehi's team includes members based abroad (e.g., Damodar Dahal in the US, Seattle area).

### Key Rules

| Member Type | Can Be Founding Member? | Can Serve on Executive Committee? | Can Work as Staff? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nepali citizen resident in Nepal | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Nepali citizen residing abroad (still holds Nepali citizenship) | Yes* | Yes* | Yes |
| NRN (foreign citizen of Nepali origin) | No | No | Yes (with work permit) |
| Foreign national (non-Nepali) | No | No | Yes (with work permit) |

*Nepali citizens residing abroad who hold valid Nepali citizenship certificates can be founding/executive members, but must attend the founding meeting or provide notarized authorization.

### Practical Implications for Jawafdehi

1. **Identify which members hold valid Nepali citizenship** (not just NRN status or foreign citizenship)
2. **Ensure at least 7 Nepal-citizen members** are available for founding
3. **Diaspora members with Nepali citizenship** can serve on the executive committee
4. **NRN or foreign citizen members** (e.g., those who have taken US/UK/Australia citizenship) cannot be on the founding committee but can:
   - Work as technical advisors or staff (with work permit)
   - Contribute as donors
   - Be informal advisors
5. For founding meeting attendance: members abroad with Nepali citizenship may need to either travel to Nepal or provide properly notarized and apostilled authorization letters

### Recommendation for Jawafdehi's 15 Members
- Map all 15 members by citizenship status immediately
- Identify the core 7+ who hold Nepali citizenship to serve as founders
- Define advisory roles for diaspora members without Nepali citizenship

---

## 6. Tax & Regulatory Status

### Tax Exemption
Under the **Income Tax Act, 2058 (2002)**:
- NGOs may obtain **income tax exemption** on grants and donations used for social welfare purposes
- Requires a **Tax Exemption Certificate** from the Inland Revenue Department
- Custom duty and VAT exemptions may be available for specific imports (with Ministry of Finance approval)

### Annual Compliance Requirements
1. **Annual renewal** at DAO (each year)
2. **Annual renewal** at Ward Office (each year)
3. **Annual renewal** at Tax Office (each year)
4. **SWC renewal** every 3 years
5. **Annual financial reports** and audits to SWC and tax authorities
6. **Annual activity reports** submitted to SWC
7. **Regular board meeting minutes** to demonstrate active governance

### 2025–2026 Regulatory Alert
In **August 2025**, Nepal's Ministry of Home Affairs issued a **draft NGO Registration, Regulation and Management Bill** that would:
- Consolidate three existing laws governing NGOs
- Shift regulatory authority from Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens to **Ministry of Home Affairs**
- Signal a more security-oriented regulatory approach

**Action**: Monitor this bill's progress. It may change registration procedures. Consult a legal advisor before filing.
